# game/ — the optional game engine add-on

A game is an Exact2 app with a world inside a `canvas`. Write gameplay in Rust and
menus, HUDs and accessible controls in Contract. The simulation and renderer share
one module, loaded after the app's first pixel. Apps without a world carry none of it.

## Optional by construction

`game/Cargo.toml` owns this workspace. It is absent from exact2's root members,
and no core crate depends on an `exact-game*` crate or Rapier. An app opts in by
linking `exact-game` and `exact-game-render` into its **GPU module**, never its
host or data module. The host loads that artifact after first paint when a canvas
needs it. An app whose other screens draw too can give the world a module of its own
(`gpu.modules` in `app.json`, LLP 1009 D6), loaded only when the world's canvas mounts.
Removing the app's game module removes the engine from its bundle.
The root build, test and boot checks stay independent of the engine workspace.
Asset names have no fixed per-surface count limit. Web loading still bounds
concurrent requests and decoded asset bytes; a queued request's timeout begins
when its fetch starts.
Weird Castle is the external consumer, with a full-screen Beacons demo in its own
engine module; its title sky never loads the engine.

The integration source is Black's `lane/game` at `126daba5` plus its working-tree
snapshot `321055e1` (2026-09-21). The original checkout remains intact.

## Start a game

Run these commands from the Exact2 repository root. With the pinned Bun and rustup
installed, `bun scripts/exact.mjs setup` installs the SDK's Rust toolchains,
wasm-bindgen, Binaryen and Bun dependencies. `setup --check` diagnoses missing or
mismatched tools. See [offline setup](#offline-setup) for populating Cargo's cache.

```sh
bun game/new.mjs ./my-game
bun game/dev.mjs ./my-game
```

Open the dev server's printed URL. Edit `my-game/logic/src/lib.rs` for gameplay or
`my-game/app.contract` for UI. Gameplay reloads carry the running world; shared
app-runtime edits reload the page. The server also prints **Open in native**.
Edits inside `Game::setup` take effect on a fresh game; in the starter, pause and
choose **Restart** to apply them.
To explore the existing sample instead, run `bun game/dev.mjs beacons`.

In another terminal, establish the new game's proof baseline:

```sh
bun game/prove.mjs ./my-game
```

The first baseline requires Linux and web agreement in all three simulation modes,
plus a Linux release run. Later invocations verify one GPU-less Linux run by default.
Use `bun my-game/proof.mjs web --screenshot-only` for pixels only; this reports
`UNVERIFIED` because it skips gameplay checks. Its screenshot is
`my-game/artifacts/web/game.png`. The starter includes movement, jumping, two
beacons, pause/restart, touch controls, a ground grid, pads, fog, sun shadows and saved glow.

A bare name (`bun game/new.mjs my-game`) creates `game/games/my-game`; a path chooses
the directory. From an empty directory, `bun /path/to/exact2/game/new.mjs .` works too.
Generation writes only inside that game. A game is the files its author writes; bakes
generate its hosts, Cargo workspace and lock, ignored, under `.shells/`.

| File | What you own |
|---|---|
| `logic/src/lib.rs` | Scene setup, typed arguments and the tick function |
| `app.contract` | Menus, HUD, layout, accessibility and app actions |
| `proof.mjs`, `logic/tests/*.rs` | Real-host assertions and hostless simulation tests |
| `pins.json` | Verified tick/save baselines, written by `prove.mjs` |
| `app.json` (optional) | Authored keys only: a title, bundle id, `game.audio`, `game.assets`, a data crate |
| `logic/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` (optional) | Only when the game adds dependencies ([below](#exact2-integration)) |

The crate is `<Game::ID>-logic` and the bundle id `com.exact.<Game::ID>`; the title
follows the directory name. Run the Rust tests with
`bun game/app/shells.mjs ./my-game --test` — in a fresh clone too, with no bake and
no environment variables. It generates `.shells/`, resolves offline and locked, runs
the determinism lints and then `cargo test` on the game's crates.

## The programming model

A game implements `setup` and `tick`. Components and resources hold all saved state;
a `Game` itself has no fields. This example is a runnable engine doc-test:

```rust
use exact_game::*;
struct Example;
impl Game for Example {
    const ID: &'static str = "example";
    type Args = ();
    fn setup(w: &mut World, _: &()) {
        w.spawn_named("player", (Transform::default(), Mesh::cube(1.0)));
    }
    fn tick(w: &mut World, _: &Input, _: &()) {
        w.require_mut::<Transform>("player").position.x += w.dt();
    }
}
let mut sim = Sim::<Example>::new(()).unwrap();
sim.run(1000.0);
assert!(sim.local_position("player").unwrap().x > 0.0);
```

- A tick calls ordinary functions in the order you write them. Physics is an
  explicit `physics::step(w)`; animation is `animation::step(w)`.
- `#[derive(Component)]` declares per-entity data; `#[derive(Resource)]` declares
  singleton data. Their `Data` representation supplies saves, hashes and agent JSON.
- Names and entity handles address the same world: `w.require_mut::<Transform>("fox")`
  names missing targets or components. `w.get::<Transform>("fox")` returns an option.
- `query().iter()` yields `(Entity, item)` with borrowed references. Consuming
  `query()` yields guarded items. `.one()` returns the sole item and refuses ambiguity.
  Iteration always follows entity order.
- Borrows are per row. A query leases the rows it matches (after `.with`/`.without`);
  `get`, `require` and the position helpers borrow one entity's row. Reading or writing
  another entity's component inside a loop just works. One row takes many shared
  borrows or one exclusive borrow; a conflict panics naming the component, the entity,
  both borrows and both source lines. See [borrowing](engine/README.md#borrowing).
- The world owns fixed ticks, time and randomness. `w.dt()` is one fixed step;
  `w.tick_end()` names the endpoint being authored. Rendering interpolates between
  completed ticks and never changes the simulation.

Each enemy reads the player's Transform inside the loop that moves the enemies'
Transforms. The query holds only the enemies' rows, so the player's row stays free:

```rust
use exact_game::*;
#[derive(Default, Component)]
struct Enemy {
    speed: f32,
}
let mut w = World::new(60, 7);
w.spawn_named("player", Transform::at(0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
w.spawn((Transform::at(10.0, 0.0, 0.0), Enemy { speed: 4.0 }));
for (_, (pose, enemy)) in w.query::<(&mut Transform, &Enemy)>().iter() {
    let player = w.require::<Transform>("player").position;
    pose.position += (player - pose.position).normalize() * enemy.speed * w.dt();
}
assert!(w.query::<&Transform>().with::<Enemy>().one().unwrap().position.x < 10.0);
```

For a complete small game, start with [the template](new/logic/src/lib.rs) or
[Beacons](games/beacons/logic/src/lib.rs). The [engine reference](engine/README.md)
covers borrowing, registration, observation, saving and loading.

### Arguments, pause and restart

`#[derive(Args)]` supplies a typed argument struct. The canvas binds its field names:
`world(seed=7, paused=paused, restart=again)`. Omitted fields use Rust defaults;
`world()` uses every default. Positional calls follow declaration order; a call
uses either names or positions. The supported scalar types are bool, u32/u64,
i32/i64, f32/f64 and String; 64-bit integers must fit the portable safe-f64 range.

Ordinary fields reconstruct setup when changed. `#[live]` fields reach each tick;
`Game::paused` reads the pause field. A `#[restart]` boolean reconstructs on either
edge: the template toggles Contract's `again` state to restart. `Game::validate`
refuses invalid arguments before changing the world or clock.
Canvas arguments keep the app's current bindings when a world is restored. Use live
arguments for app-owned settings; keep choices that should travel with a game save
in components or resources.

After the first GPU build, the compiler and dev loop check surface names and
arguments against the emitted `.shells/surfaces.json`, including hidden branches
and imports. Rust argument edits reach that declaration through the next GPU build.
The dev compiler retains its last good plan on an error.

### Movement and appearance

| Task | Existing engine operation |
|---|---|
| Move and jump without physics | `w.character("player").step(input.stick_xz("move"), input.pressed("jump"))` |
| Change speed while playing | `w.require_mut::<character::Character>("player").speed = 8.0` preserves velocity and the rest of the character. |
| Move against colliders | [Physics controller example](physics/tests/living.rs), with explicit `Move`, `Jump` and `Gravity` |
| Follow the player | Attach `Follow`; the scene steps it after the tick. Call `scene::follow(w)` explicitly to choose an earlier order. |
| Find a nearby unlit beacon | `w.nearest_xz_mut::<Beacon>("player", 1.5, \|b\| !b.lit)` returns its entity and mutable component together. |
| Count for the HUD | `w.count::<Beacon>(\|b\| b.lit)` |
| Grid and fog | `Material::grid(color, spacing)` and the saved `Environment`/`Fog` resource |
| Fade a glowing mesh | Attach `Glow(Tween)` to `Material::glow`; retarget once and let the renderer sample at frame time. |
| Fade a point light | Attach `Lit(Spring)` and call `lit.to(w.tick_end(), intensity)`. |

`Character` saves velocity and configuration and reports displacement, grounded,
jumped and landed. `near`/`near_xz` use current global poses, inclusive radii and
entity-order ties. The starter uses Character's movement defaults and sets its ground
height and bounds explicitly.

`Glow` multiplies authored emissive output. Keep the material's authored colour
constant; copying the same animated intensity into it applies the effect twice.
See the [renderer reference](render/README.md#effects) for appearance conventions.

## Publications and events

Publish HUD values by name with ordinary Rust scalars:

```rust
use exact_game::*;
let w = World::new(120, 7);
w.publish("lit", 1);
assert_eq!(w.published("lit").unwrap().as_number(), Some(1.0));
```

Contract reads that record through the surface's name:

```contract
shape Hud
  lit: number

component Screen
  resource hud = exactSurface("world") as shape Hud
  view
    canvas surface=world() width="100%" height="100%"
      text `Lit ${hud.lit}`
```

For a structured HUD, `w.publish_record(&hud)` publishes the fields of a `Data` record
together. Nested records, lists, options and scalars retain their names and JSON types.
Contract validates kinds against the shape: missing fields default, extra fields
are ignored. Enum variants are not Contract values. Rust field names are not
checked against the Contract shape at bake time. A rebuild or restore publishes
again; no app data module is needed.
Only the first live canvas owns a given surface's public record.

`w.emit("won")` separately queues a string for the canvas's `message=` handler.
Undelivered events save in order but stay outside the simulation hash.

## Proof pins

`pins.json` owns the game's expected tick hashes and continuation-save digests.
The generated proof uses `pin(tick, snapshot)` and `pinSave(name, path)`;
Rust tests use `sim.assert_pin(include_str!("../../pins.json"))`.

```sh
bun game/prove.mjs ./my-game
bun game/prove.mjs ./my-game --hosts linux,web --compare-saves
bun game/prove.mjs ./my-game --hosts linux,ios --device --phone <device-id> --compare-saves
bun my-game/proof.mjs linux --paranoid
bun game/prove.mjs ./my-game --repin --reason "describe the intended state change"
```

Repinning runs Off, Save and FreshGame, requires matching source inputs and host
observations, and includes a Linux release check. It refuses failures or a missing
requested browser, leaving the pins unchanged. Existing pins may be updated with
`--hosts linux` explicitly; the first baseline always requires Linux and web.
Every update records the matching source-input digest; a Git commit is recorded
when one exists. A game without commits can repin under the same agreement checks.
`CHROME` selects the headless browser.

Paranoid runs check simulation and saves. Each tick uses the normal restore path,
which resets presentation interpolation; use ordinary runs for appearance and
motion comparisons.

`PASS` means the complete saved baseline was checked. Partial/build-only runs and
baseline collection report `UNVERIFIED`; failed assertions report `FAIL`. A
screenshot alone is not a verified simulation. `prove.mjs` prints its unique
`ARTIFACTS` directory; direct `proof.mjs` runs use `artifacts/<host>/`.
Use `--report` on `prove.mjs` to explain recorded stalls and refusals.
`ios` selects the simulator; `--device` selects a paired phone and requires an
accessible development signing key. Direct proofs accept `ios --device --phone
<device-id>` too. Phone artifacts and build receipts use `ios-device`; the proof's
1280 × 720 logical viewport fits into the phone window for equal input dimensions.

The [shared proof runner](proof.mjs) handles builds, sessions, transcripts and
cleanup. Each game's proof owns its assertions. `check` records failures while
independent assertions continue. The terminal shows checks and failure details;
`replies.json` retains complete operation replies. Browser runs provide canvas pixels; the GPU-less
Linux host exercises simulation, input, Contract UI, CPU picks and saves.

### Compare captured world state

In a proof or an agent session, capture inspected state before and after an action:

```js
import {captureWorld, diffWorlds, formatWorldDiff} from '/path/to/exact2/game/proof.mjs';
import {writeFileSync} from 'node:fs';
const before = await captureWorld(session, 'world');
await session.world('world').hold('KeyW', 500);
const after = await captureWorld(session, 'world');
writeFileSync('before.json', JSON.stringify(before));
writeFileSync('after.json', JSON.stringify(after));
console.log(formatWorldDiff(diffWorlds(before, after)));
```

Compare those files later with `bun game/proof.mjs diff before.json after.json`.
Exit codes: 0 for equal inspected values and hashes, 1 for differences, 2 for a
refused capture. The report shows field paths and before/after values, including
added/removed entities, components, resources and array entries. It includes
arguments, input and published values; tick/hash are report metadata. Named
entities match by name even if their slots change; unnamed entities match by
slot ID (inspection does not expose generations, so slot reuse is indistinguishable).
Arrays compare by index. The default report retains 100 differences and counts
omitted ones; `diffWorlds(a, b, {limit: 500})` changes that output limit.

These JSON captures are **not `.world` binary saves** or a complete explanation of
a hash. Opaque executor state stays opaque; inspection can omit or round internal
values. A differing hash with equal inspected values is reported explicitly.
Capture on the agent clock without concurrent drives. Mixed-tick/hash reads and
truncated entity lists (currently over 512 entities) are refused. Capturing and
comparing state does not advance the clock or mutate the world.

## The agent's interface

Use Exact2's same eight operations: `tree`, `screenshot`, `tap`, `type`, `state`,
`layout`, `logs` and `clock`. An entity is addressed as `world:player`.

```sh
EXACT_APP_DIR=./my-game EXACT_WEB_DIST=./my-game/dist bun scripts/agent.mjs web \
  "tap play" "type world key KeyW for 1500" "layout world:player" \
  "state world:* busy" logs "screenshot run.world world save"
```

For a `prove.mjs` web build, set `EXACT_WEB_DIST` to the printed artifact directory's
`dist/`. `state world:*` reads up to 512 entities; `under world:player` narrows it.
`clock settle` advances the owned clock and explains remaining work instead of sleeping.

In a proof, `session.world('world')` supplies `hold`, `run`, `settle`, `get`,
`layout`, `snapshot` and `save`. A held key is released on the same carrier even
when advancing time fails. `open({fresh:true, world:'run.world'})` opens a new
process and restores when Play creates the surface. Current app bindings win over
saved arguments; `restoredFrom` exposes the saved ones while `restored` is true.

Restore validates first and installs the decoded world without running setup.
Register types that first appear mid-game in `Game::register`; registration receives
only setup/restart arguments and must have no gameplay side effects. A refused
restore stays visible in `state.world.restoreError` and logs while the fresh world
remains usable. Captures and restore inputs are limited to 256 MiB.

The same driver reaches web, macOS, Linux and iOS. iOS agent input is
labelled `recognized`; it is not physical-touch evidence. Pointer-completed HUD
buttons return focus to the input canvas, while keyboard activation retains button
focus and consumes its activation keys. Native hover/focus-visible parity remains
[open work](../QUEUE.md).

## Determinism — the contract (LLP 1046.001 D5)

Same seed, tick-stamped inputs and completed tick must produce the same world hash
on every host. Pixels have a tolerance; simulation state is exact.

1. Use only world time and the world's RNG (`rand`, `chance`, `pick` or `rng`).
2. Use `exact_game::math` for transcendentals, such as sine.
3. Keep tick iteration ordered; no `HashMap` iteration or threads in a tick.
4. Keep semantic state in components and resources, without interior mutation
   through shared references. The journal is telemetry, outside hashes and observation.

Clippy holds every game's logic library to rules 1–3 with the SDK's
[`app/determinism/clippy.toml`](app/determinism/clippy.toml): std float transcendentals
(`sin` … `powi`, `hypot`, `mul_add`), `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `RandomState`, `Instant`,
`SystemTime`, `std::thread::spawn` and `rand`'s ambient generators are refused, each
naming its replacement. `sqrt` is correctly rounded and allowed; glam is built with
`libm`, so `Vec3::length`, `Quat::slerp` and the other glam methods are portable. The
lints run in `shells.mjs --test`, before first pins and `--repin`, and in every
production-profile bake (web, Apple, release Linux, deploy); the gpu-dev edit loop
leaves them to those. An `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_types)]` on an item is a
visible exception — a `HashMap` that is only ever looked up, say. Tests may time
themselves. Setting `RUSTFLAGS` replaces the workspace's `-fp-contract=off`, so a
game build under it is refused until the flag is appended.

Seekable advances observe the final tick pair. Ambient entities and explicitly
ambient resources/derived publications stay outside rest observation, but retain
their save rules. Settle does not pause time or force physics bodies asleep.
See the [engine reference](engine/README.md) for those declarations and their limits.

Parity evidence applies to exercised operations and hosts. [Bench receipts](bench/README.md)
and [authoring diaries](diaries/001-scores.md) record measurements and remaining targets.

## Exact2 integration

The first bake derives host adapters and `.shells/app.json` from the authored
manifest. It does not rewrite an existing `app.json`. Contract owns layout, UI,
accessibility and controls; the world owns the canvas contents. Hosts consume
declaration data without a build dependency on the engine or gameplay. The GPU
build writes that declaration directly, without linking the host bake.

For app operations such as Save/Continue, declare a linked Rust data source in
`app.json` alongside the game's entry point:

```json
"game": {
  "crate": "my-game-logic", "type": "MyGame",
  "data": { "crate": "my-game-data", "type": "AppData" }
}
```

Own its code and manifest under `data/`, with `package.workspace = "../.shells"`;
like any added dependency, it resolves against the SDK lock or the game's own.
The type implements `DataSource + Default`; the generated hosts supply the existing
`Storage<D>` adapter. Return synchronous resource placeholders before `activate`;
storage work starts after first pixel. This linked composition uses `rust: false`.
Games without `game.data` add no data-source dependency.
[Tennis](games/tennis/README.md) uses one for HTTP: the world publishes a numbered
question, `resource plan = jev(hud.ask)` posts it, and the answer returns as a
`#[live]` string argument that the tick applies only when its id matches.

`Request::capture_surface("world")` returns complete carried bytes through
`Outcome::Surface(SurfaceOutcome::Captured(bytes))`. Chain an ordinary atomic file
write to save them. Continue reads that file, sends
`Request::restore_surface("world", bytes)`, and completes on `SurfaceOutcome::Restored`.
Declare `surface.read world` / `surface.write world` plus the needed filesystem grants.
The host requires exactly one live named surface, settles its pending assets, and
refuses retired requests. Surface payloads are limited to 16 MiB; the existing
storage protocol separately bounds the serialized file request. Pause before saving
or restoring when the surrounding UI should hold the game still. Set the canvas
`inert` while the request is pending to release held controls and prevent new input.

A game owns one generated Cargo workspace and keeps final products and receipts in
its own `target/`, including intermediate builds, so copies of a game cannot
overwrite each other's units. Cargo's standard `CARGO_BUILD_BUILD_DIR` overrides
that location when explicitly set. Without
`logic/Cargo.toml`, the workspace's generated member builds `logic/src/lib.rs` and
`logic/tests`, `examples` and `benches` where the author wrote them.

The SDK owns one lock, [`app/shells.lock`](app/shells.lock): the lock of the union of
every generated shell's dependencies. A game's workspace starts from it and keeps its
subset; each version must be the SDK lock's, so bakes, deploys and proofs still resolve
`--locked --offline` and no local cache chooses a version. A game that adds a
dependency writes `logic/Cargo.toml` (`package.workspace = "../.shells"`, SDK crates as
`exact-game.workspace = true`) and captures its own `Cargo.lock` with
`bun game/app/shells.mjs ./my-game --update-lock`; commit and review that lock. SDK
crates alone need no lock of the game's own. When the SDK's dependencies change,
`bun game/app/shells.mjs --update-lock` refreshes the SDK lock, and
`bun app/shells.mjs --test` refuses a stale one. The game workspace also carries
the core’s vendored patches and `apple-dev` profile; the existing SDK test checks
those against the root workspace. Web builds retain the game’s non-contracting
floating-point flag alongside the core’s path-remapping flags.

Linux development uses `gpu-dev` with separate completed host and GPU receipts;
a logic-only edit can rebuild the GPU alone. Release/production bakes bind its exact
digest. Generated profiles disable floating-point contraction; `gpu-dev` disables
debug assertions and overflow checks as release does. These profiles come from `game/Cargo.toml`, not authored per-game host code.

`game.assets: true` selects the model-capable module; `game.audio: true` links the
audio executor, which plays synthesized and sampled sounds. Sampled sounds need only
`game.audio: true`. Optional capabilities are separate artifacts/executors, never
Cargo features on a core crate. The engine's own workspace is outside Exact2's
five core checks.

### Assets, animation and placed UI

Put models, sprite PNGs and WAV or Ogg Vorbis sounds under `art/`;
[the baker](bake/README.md) produces validated `.model`, `.tex` and `.sound` assets,
each texture as RGBA8, BC and ASTC files of which a device fetches one
([texture payloads](bake/README.md#texture-payloads)). Name the authored `x.tex`
everywhere. Declare simulation dependencies in `Game::ASSETS`; setup waits for them.
Models and sprites need the asset-capable module; sounds and untextured emitters do
not. See [the audio executor](audio/README.md) and
[the audio fixture](games/audio-fixture/logic/src/lib.rs) for sampled sounds.

For a data-authored level, derive `Data` for its record and declare `Game::LEVEL`.
JSON levels work in the primitive module and need no `game.assets` setting or art importer.
Setup reads it with `w.level::<T>(name)` after the
asset barrier. `w.generated(name, mesh_data)` registers immutable generated geometry;
saves check its reconstructed identity rather than storing render vertices. See
[the level example](games/asset-fixture/logic/src/lib.rs) and [engine reference](engine/README.md).

Animation order is explicit: `animation::step` → apply root motion → query sockets.
`SocketFollow` attaches to a joint without changing the saved local transform.
See [the skinned example](games/skinned-fixture/logic/src/lib.rs).

`Placed::child("sign")` attaches the direct Contract child with `testId="sign"` to
a world plane. The name survives reordering; duplicate names or owners refuse.
Layout, accessibility and ordinary controls stay with the app host. See
[the placement game](games/placement-fixture/logic/src/lib.rs) and
[its UI](games/placement-fixture/app.contract).

From `game/` (an unset `EXACT_UPDATE_TRUST` bakes development trust):

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
bun test ./proof.test.mjs
bun app/shells.mjs --test
```

The last command checks the SDK lock, then lints and tests every in-tree game's
crates in its own workspace. Generated adapters are products, not empty test harnesses.
Pass an app directory to test only that app: `bun app/shells.mjs /path/to/my-game --test`.
Run the affected game's real-host proof too. Device lifecycle tests are opt-in:
`cargo test -p exact-game-render surface_lifecycle -- --ignored` on a GPU host.
Apple host builds use Xcode's developer directory and no inherited `SDKROOT`.

### Offline setup

The checkout expects sibling `../ibex` and `../snapback-sb4` source repositories.
For an isolated checkout, links in its private parent may point at existing copies.
Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` at the Exact2 root before Cargo validation.

If the Cargo cache is empty, first generate the game, then materialize its adapters
and fetch the SDK lock's versions from the Exact2 root:

```sh
bun game/app/shells.mjs ./my-game
cargo fetch --manifest-path ./my-game/.shells/Cargo.toml
```

The generated shell starts from the SDK lock, so the fetch downloads its versions; a
resolution that would take any other version is refused.
