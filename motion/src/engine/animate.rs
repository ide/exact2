//! lowered executors), D10 (settle ignores infinite iterations)
//!
//! A node's `animation` row arrives with each commit, as its `transition`
//! row does. An entry whose name was not in the node's previous list starts
//! now; one that was keeps its start and takes the new timing (CSS: changing
//! a longhand re-times a running animation, it does not restart it); one that
//! left is cancelled. Pausing holds the local time and resuming continues
//! from it. A sampling host gets the animated values from
//! [`Engine::frame`](super::Engine::frame); a lowering host (Apple, whose
//! compositor runs the animation, and the web, whose browser does) reads the
//! plays and never samples them per frame.
