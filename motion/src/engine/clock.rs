//! Clock timelines in the engine: animations that share a phase (LLP 1055.002).
//!
//! A node whose `animation-timeline` is `-exact-clock(Name)` plays its animations on
//! the clock as any node does, from a start chosen so that every animation on
//! `Name` is in step (D4): the most recent cycle boundary on the timeline at
//! or before the moment it starts. A timeline is one number, its origin, set
//! when an animation joins it idle (D3). Nothing here runs per frame: a start
//! is chosen once, when a play starts, resumes or moves onto a clock, and
//! every executor plays from it as it plays any other start (Core
//! Animation's `beginTime`).
//!
//! Inside a commit ([`Engine::hold_clock_joins`]) the joins wait for its end,
//! when every node's rows are applied, so the start a join takes does not
//! depend on the order the commit's nodes were applied in: a member another
//! node's row ends in the same commit is gone, a drag-bound play is not a
//! member, and a join reads the timing its row ends the commit with.
