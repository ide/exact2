//! The engine: per-node presentation state under a seekable clock.
//!
//! @ref LLP 1002 §3 (the frame; who owns the clock); LLP 1003 §3
//!
//! The host owns time. It tells the engine what the kernel committed
//! ([`Engine::observe`], one [`Change`] per animatable row that changed),
//! advances the clock ([`Engine::advance`]), and takes the presentation values
//! to paint ([`Engine::frame`]). The engine holds no thread, no timer, and no
//! reference to the kernel: nodes are numbers the host chose.
//!
//! Because every running transition is a closed-form function of clock time,
//! `advance(t)` is a seek. A test advances to `0.3` and reads; an agent's
//! `clock` operation advances to [`Engine::settle_time`] and reads; nothing
//! ever waits. On the web none of this runs per frame — the browser is the
//! executor — but the same engine under a virtual clock is the oracle a web
//! host's output is compared against.
