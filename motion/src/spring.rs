//! @ref LLP 1002 §2 (declared deviation: `spring()`)
//!
//! A damped harmonic oscillator in closed form, sampled at true elapsed time
//! from its anchor, so a sample depends on the clock and never on the frame
//! cadence that reached it. Its duration is not authored; it is derived from
//! when the spring comes to rest.
//!
//! On the web the same closed form is *lowered*, not evaluated per frame: the
//! evaluator samples it once into keyframes ([`keyframes`]) and the browser
//! plays them through the Web Animations API. One curve, two executors.
