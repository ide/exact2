//! `transition`: the declaration, and CSS's rules for running one.

//! @ref LLP 1002 §2; CSS Transitions Level 1 §3 ("Starting of transitions")
//!
//! A [`Transitions`] list is the value of a node's `transition` style row in
//! the kernel — the same row a web host emits as CSS. The rest of this module
//! is what a browser does with that row: start a transition when the target
//! changes, interrupt it from the current value when the target changes
//! again, and shorten it when the change reverses (§3.2's reversing-adjusted
//! start value and reversing shortening factor), so a hover-off halfway
//! through a hover-on takes half the time on every platform, not just the web.
