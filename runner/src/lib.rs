//! The plan runner.
//!
//! @ref LLP 1004 D4 (data comes from a Rust data source through one seam)
//! @ref LLP 1004 D5 (a dev reload is a restart)
//! @ref LLP 0485 §8 (the update loop; research)
//!
//! A [`Runner`] loads one validated plan against one [`DataSource`] and drives
//! one kernel. Nothing here is app-specific: the plan is data, the data source
//! is the app's Rust crate behind one trait, and the kernel is the consumer of
//! every op the runner emits.
//!
//! - [`vm`] — the expression VM: a stack machine over [`Value`]s, one
//!   dispatch loop, typed traps, never UB.
//! - [`stdlib`] — the roster's implementations, once.
//! - [`strings`] — strings as JavaScript has them: order, `slice` and
//!   `replaceAll` over UTF-16 code units.
//! - [`compare`] — value identity, substitution and `==`, once.
//! - [`held`] — a settled resource's value; a compiled one no one else
//!   holds is released to the plan's bytes.
//! - [`bridge`] — values to kernel props and style rows, through the kernel's
//!   own `set_dynamic`.
//! - [`delivery`] — what this binary and its update store know about
//!   delivery (LLP 1030 D7): one resource the runner answers itself.
//! - [`device`] — `device.*` grants and the one table every host's
//!   permission spelling derives from (LLP 1069.008).
//! - [`instance`] — the instance tree: nodes, `when`/`match` arms, keyed
//!   `each` rows, and the ops that keep the kernel equal to it.
//! - [`runner`] — boot, actions, events, resources, timers, the clock.
//! - [`agent`] — the agent API's read operations (`tree`, `state`, `logs`),
//!   answered from the runner and kernel for every host.
//! - [`head`] — the document's head: the active `head` elements' fields,
//!   for every host's page, window or scene title (LLP 1048.003 D1).
//! - [`uses`] — what a plan uses beyond the core, from its bytes (LLP 1047
//!   D2): what a host must link to run it.
//!
//! Time is a number the host supplies (`Runner::advance`); timers fire from it,
//! so an agent seeks instead of waiting — the same clock discipline as
//! `exact-motion`.
