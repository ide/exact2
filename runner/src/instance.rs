//! The instance tree, and the ops that keep the kernel equal to it.
//!
//! @ref LLP 0485 §8.2 (keyed instance management, never reconciliation of
//! trees; research)
//!
//! The plan's nodes and regions are *sites*. An instance is one realization
//! of a site: a kernel view for a node, an active arm for `when`/`match`, one
//! row per key for `each`. An update visits only the sites whose reads
//! ([`deps`]) include an input that changed since the last update, or an
//! enclosing row or arm whose value changed, and there evaluates only the
//! stale bindings; it emits exactly the kernel ops that make the kernel
//! equal to the result: a binding's op only when its value changed,
//! `SetChildren` only when a child list changed, create/destroy only when a
//! key appeared or went away. [`Update::full`] evaluates everything, the
//! reference an incremental update must equal. There is no tree diff: a
//! keyed row keeps its views across reorders because its key, not its
//! position, is its identity.
