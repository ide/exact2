# Vendored ibex2 and ibex2-sqlite — Exact patches

- **Upstream:** `https://github.com/expo/ibex.git`, commit
  `e3e00690` (2026-10-04, on `main`):
  `crates/ibex2` → `vendor/ibex2`, `crates/ibex2-sqlite` → `vendor/ibex2-sqlite`.
- **Why vendored (Charlie, 2026-09-22):** a fresh clone must build without a
  sibling `../ibex` checkout. The compiler includes `src/bindings/storage.d.ts`
  as text, `exact-js` compiles `src/engine/ibex2_jsi.cc` and the binding
  scripts, and seven manifests depend on the crates.
- **Patches:** four Exact-only patches below and the Windows connection and native
  filesystem backports described next. Otherwise the copy is the commit's tracked tree, byte for byte,
  plus this file.
- **Not vendored:** the Hermes engine and `hermesc` builds. They are
  hand-built outputs in the ibex checkout (`ios/Frameworks-vanilla`,
  `tools/hermes-vanilla`, `linux-vanilla`), needed only by `exact-js`.
- **Update:** from a clean ibex checkout at the new commit,

  ```sh
  rm -rf vendor/ibex2 vendor/ibex2-sqlite
  git -C ../ibex archive --format=tar <commit> crates/ibex2 crates/ibex2-sqlite \
    | tar -x -C vendor --strip-components=1
  ```

  then restore this file with the new commit and date, and reapply patches
  3, 4, 5 and 6 (`git show ae0c186a9 a268b5512 001e43d03 -- vendor/ibex2`, and
  patches 5 and 6 by `git log -1 --format=%h -S run_document -- vendor/ibex2`
  and `git log -1 --format=%h -S entries_text -- vendor/ibex2`).
  Keep the Windows connection backport unless the new snapshot contains it.
  Keep the native filesystem backport and its shared-parser adaptation too.
  Patch 4 replaces `src/grant.rs` wholesale, so keep the vendored file
  rather than merging upstream's: a grant-grammar change upstream must be
  ported to `grants/src/lib.rs` by hand.

## Windows connection readiness — upstream backport

Backport Ibex `3f72340e` (2026-10-04), reviewed in upstream LLP 0068's Windows
outbound connection section. Winsock can return a peer address before a pending
nonblocking connection is usable. Windows now waits for writable/exceptional
socket readiness and checks `SO_ERROR` before handoff, with bounded cancellation
polling on the caller's thread. The new module and tests match upstream; the
WinSock feature and Windows dispatch are added here. Exact patch 3's Unix poll
implementation remains unchanged, and its helper is compiled only off Windows.
No grant, TLS, Hermes ABI or SQLite changes accompany this backport.

## Windows native filesystem grants — bounded upstream backport

Backport only Ibex `cc71b185`'s filesystem slice (2026-10-04), reviewed in Exact
LLP 1027.001 D2 and upstream LLP 0068. The snapshot remains `e3e00690`; no other
runtime, binding, Events, Blob/FormData, Hermes or native SQLite change follows.

- `src/stdlib/{app_fs_windows,fs,windows_directory}.rs` and new
  `windows_fs.rs`, `windows_fs_tests.rs` carry the retained drive/ancestor/operand
  backend, strict native leaves, locality and reparse refusal, native case policy,
  pre-mutation regularity/identity checks and focused Windows regressions.
  `mod.rs` enables only those Windows modules. `Cargo.toml` adds only the two
  Windows API feature families needed for retained-drive device qualification.
- Exact patch 4 still owns the grammar. `src/grant.rs` keeps its exact-grants
  reexport; its realization helper is the unchanged lexical set on Windows.
  `fs.rs` retains the Exact realization helper call on the existing admission
  path. No upstream `grant.rs` replacement was copied.
- `src/stdlib/windows_path.rs` reexports the pure `exact_grants::WindowsPath`.
  Exact moved the upstream lexical parser and quoted filesystem-target grammar
  into `grants/`, retaining its `doc:/` namespace and source-line scopes. Native
  syntax is recognized on all build hosts; execution remains Windows-only.
- Exact's native NT leaf open/rename calls also use that shared component
  validator before their existing encoding checks. This avoids a divergent
  control-character/UTF-16 boundary; an added Windows test couples parser and
  NT leaf refusal. Legacy `app:/` names retain their existing checks.

Native SQLite execution remains refused. The existing app SQLite provider and
its trusted-embedder/stable-ancestry contract are unchanged. Raw Rust remains
trusted; filesystem grants govern capability calls rather than forming an OS
sandbox. Native paths pin identities per operation, and hard links retain their
ordinary shared contents. Browser builds carry native tuples inertly.

## Upstreamed (no longer patches)

Patches 1 and 2 landed in ibex as `fbe2baee` (2026-10-04), byte for byte
except for code comments retargeted to Ibex LLPs (LLP 0067 §2, LLP 0059.000
§3.5 and §3.12). Upstreaming them added two things:

- **Userinfo is refused in origin grants.** `https://*.example.com@evil.com`
  had parsed as `*.evil.com`, and `https://api.example.com@evil.com` as
  `evil.com`. Both parsers now refuse any `net.fetch`/`net.websocket`
  target containing `@`: ibex2's, and `grants/src/lib.rs` with
  `host/web/navigation.js`'s `networkTuple`, held together by
  `host/web/tests/fixtures/grants.json`.
- **`fetch_limits` pins the new redirect rule.** It had pinned credentials
  surviving a granted cross-origin hop. exact2 never ran that Hermes-gated
  test against its copy.

1. *Subdomain `net.fetch` grants; credentials dropped on a cross-origin
   redirect* (12bacca23, Charlie 2026-09-26, LLP 1054.000 R5).
2. *A listening WebSocket under `net.websocket`* (0736a4ab7, LLP 1069.004
   slice 3).

## Patch 3: the rustls transport builds on macOS — Exact only

Charlie, 2026-09-29 (LLP 1048.000 D10, "The server's transport"): the
render host, a server rather than an app on a device, fetches over rustls on
macOS too.

- `Cargo.toml`: the rustls transport's dependencies (`ureq`, `rustls`,
  `rustls-native-certs`, `webpki-roots`, `socket2`) are target dependencies
  everywhere but Apple's device platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS),
  where they were everywhere but Apple.
- `src/transport/mod.rs`: `rustls_http` and `RustlsHttpTransport` build on
  macOS too. `default_transport` is unchanged: `NSURLSession` on Apple.
- `src/transport/rustls_http.rs`: a pending connect waits in `poll(2)` for the
  socket to be writable instead of sleeping 10 ms between checks. The former
  trust-store cache patch is now upstream: its lazy process cache also avoids
  loading system roots for unused transports or plain HTTP without a TLS proxy.
- Not for upstream: it exists for one embedder's server role.

## Patch 4: one grant grammar shared with the web runner — Exact only

It also carries the `doc:/` path namespace (80dbd7642, LLP 1069.010 D1, the
documents a person chose, resolved by the host beside `app:/`), which went
into `grant.rs` before patch 4 moved the grammar and was never listed here.
It lives in `grants/src/lib.rs` now.

2026-10-02, LLP 1016 D6 / LLP 1018 D3: `src/grant.rs` reexports
`exact-grants` (`../../grants`), the previous parser and authority types moved
unchanged into a pure crate. URL normalization remains the `url` crate's,
including IDNA and address normalization. Secret/scope name validation is
shared too. Native filesystem realization stays here: the executor maps
filesystem prefixes through its resolver; the shared crate performs no I/O.
The two realization call sites in `src/stdlib/fs.rs` and `app_fs_unix.rs` use
the local `crate::grant::realized_fs` helper, and `src/secrets/mod.rs` delegates
name validation to `exact_grants::valid_name`. These are part of this patch.

The runner, Rust-only bakes, and wasm host now use the same parser as native
bindings. One invalid I/O line grants nothing. The current JS target holds
the same grammar against `host/web/tests/fixtures/grants.json` using browser
URLs, and scopes module fetch and secret access to the parsed set.

## Windows refresh, 2026-10-04

The complete `e3e00690` snapshot includes Windows app storage and native SQLite,
the upstream grouped installer, structured clone and WebCrypto work. Windows
file operations retain owned directory handles and refuse reparse nodes;
SQLite uses its native VFS under the trusted embedder's stable-ancestry contract,
with database and sidecar reparse preflight. See Exact LLP 1027.001 D2 and
[Ibex LLP 0068](https://github.com/expo/ibex/blob/e3e00690/llp/0068-the-standard-library-for-a-rust-consumer.spec.md).
Exact still disables Ibex's default features; the refresh does not automatically
enable the new crypto implementation or claim a Windows Exact TypeScript engine.

## Patch 5: documents the person chose (`doc:`) — Exact only

2026-10-04, LLP 1069.010 D1 (files F2): a TypeScript source's `storage.fs`
reaches a `doc:/<n>/<name>` path as a Rust source's storage request does,
under the same `fs.read doc:/` / `fs.write doc:/` grants.

- `src/stdlib/fs.rs`: `Document`, `Documents` (the embedder's table, a
  `doc:` path to its real location) and `run_document`, the one executor
  both languages run on a native host: the grant checked on the path as
  spelt, `rename`/`copyFile`/`realpath` refused, `rm` one file or empty
  folder beneath the chosen document, the real path never in an error.
  `run` refuses a `doc:` path instead of calling it relative.
- `src/task.rs`, `src/bindings.rs`: `set_documents` on the runtime state
  and the `Context`; `src/boundary_abi.rs`'s `run_fs` sends a `doc:` path
  to `run_document`.
- Not for upstream until Ibex has a picker that mints such paths.

## Patch 6: a scope's kept values in one directory read — Exact only

2026-10-06. `KvStore::entries` returns every key with its value. The
default is `keys` then `get`. `FileStore` reads the directory once and reads
each file under the listed name, so it skips `get`'s per-key `canonicalize`.
That check is a `realpath` of the whole path, about 3 ms of an iOS launch
with a dozen kept answers. `Kv::entries_text` is its text form, which Exact's
Apple host reads into the runner's launch snapshot.

- `src/kv.rs`: the trait method and the `FileStore` override, with checks in
  the listing, symlink and case-variant tests.
- `src/host.rs`: `Kv::entries_text`.
- Candidate for upstream.
