//! Delivery baking (LLP 1030 D3a, D8; 1030.000 D4, D7): the compatibility id
//! a build writes beside its plan, and the embedded receipt it checks against
//! the publisher's. Build-side only: app build scripts, `js/bake` and the dev
//! server link it. The compiler (`contract`) and the runtimes do not, so they
//! carry neither ed25519 (through `exact-update`) nor naga (through
//! `exact-gpu-reflect`).
