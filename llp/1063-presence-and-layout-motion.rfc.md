# LLP 1063: Presence and layout motion — `exit-animation` and `layout-transition`

**Type:** RFC
**Status:** Implemented 2026-09-26 (web, iOS, macOS; Linux layout only, exit refused)
**Systems:** Kernel (style rows, receipt), Motion (`exact-motion`), Contract, Web, Apple, Linux
**Author:** Claude (Opus 5.5) for Seth Webster
**Date:** 2026-09-26 (gaps closed 2026-09-27: size, windowed rows, the web's
measure, load, ghost and springs, first moves, XCTests)
**Related:** LLP 1002/1003 (motion v1), LLP 1055 D5 (keyframes and `animation` — the grammar reused here), LLP 1041 §8.12 (the numeric-height trial, unchanged), `rules/DEFERRED.md` §Motion


**Ruled (Charlie, 2026-09-27, after the review of PR #47: "we can try (a) for now"):** both rows stay, declared as deviations in LLP 1001. CSS has no way to animate a removed node, and View Transitions animate snapshots of the whole document one at a time, which a list whose rows move every few hundred milliseconds can't use. So the web runs these rows by FLIP, the technique web layout-animation libraries use. Chrome is not an oracle for them: parity is one recorded timeline compared across hosts. If the emulation's bug rate stays high after the 2026-09-27 fixes (`issues/20260927-web-presence-*`), the fallback is to drop `layout-transition` and keep `exit-animation`.


> **Spelling (2026-10-06):** `exit-animation` and `layout-transition` are spelled `-exact-exit-animation` and `-exact-layout-transition` since [LLP 1081](1081-names-exact-invents.rfc.md). This document keeps the spelling it was written with, as the record.

## Summary

Two things a motion designer reaches for first were missing: a node that
disappears could not animate out (a destroyed node was forgotten at once),
and siblings jumped when content around them changed. This adds both as
style rows, in the LLP 1002 shape: the kernel carries the declaration, the
browser executes on the web, `exact-motion` executes natively under the same
seekable clock.

```
keyframes leave
  to opacity=0 scale=0.96

style Row
  layout-transition="320ms cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1)"
  exit-animation="leave 200ms cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1) both"

component List
  state shown = true
  action toggle writes shown
    shown = not shown
  view
    column
      button press=toggle
        text "Toggle"
      when shown
        text "First" class=Row
      text "Second" class=Row
```

Pressing Toggle removes "First" from the tree at once; it stays on screen,
fading and shrinking in place for 200 ms, while "Second" slides up into its
place over 320 ms. A box that grows or shrinks (an accordion opening, a card
whose row left) changes size under the same row. Pressing again creates a new "First" (no exit, no slide:
first seen) and "Second" slides back down.

## Decisions

**D1 — Two rows, CSS grammar.** `exit-animation` (bit 145, codec
`animations`) is the `animation` shorthand, its names resolved against the
plan's `keyframes` table by the runner exactly as LLP 1055 D5 resolves
`animation` (same parser, same table, a literal's unknown name the same
`lower-animation-name` error). `layout-transition` (bit 146,
codec `transitions`) is a `transition` shorthand; the last declaration that
names no property (or `all`) governs, so `layout-transition="320ms
cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1)"` and `"spring(300, 30, 1)"` both work, and one
naming `opacity` moves nothing. `transition: all` never moves a box: layout
is not a CSS property and is outside `Property::ALL`. *Rejected:* a
`layout` transition-property inside `transition` — `all` would silently start
covering it, changing every app that writes `transition: all`.

**D2 — An exit must end.** The schema marks the row `"ends": true`; the
generator validates it with `Animations::validate_ending`, refusing
`infinite` or `paused` (`AnimationError::Endless`) on both ingress paths, and
the compiler refuses the literal first (`lower-exit-endless`).

**D3 — The kernel chooses who leaves.** `CommitReceipt::exits` lists each
destroyed subtree root that declares the row, with the parent it left from
(a producer detaches with `SetChildren` before it destroys; the kernel
remembers the parent a detached exit-declaring child had) and its row as it
was. Not listed: a node created in the same batch (never presented), a root
or inline run (nowhere to stay), a node whose parent the same batch creates
or destroys (it goes inside that parent; nested exits play only on the
outermost). A `when` arm turning false and an `each` row leaving both arrive
this way, inside a `list` row as anywhere. A windowed list destroys rows that
scroll away as well as rows whose item left the data; the runner's window
(and a virtualized collection) empties the row wrapper's `listItemKey` for
the latter alone, before it detaches it. A wrapper with a key simply goes; an
emptied one leaves as the row, where the window placed it, playing its one
root's `exit-animation` (a row of several roots goes at once).

**D4 — The leaving view is a ghost, out of layout.** Siblings take its place
immediately; it keeps its last laid-out box and paints above its old siblings
(web: `position:absolute` at its last offset box, which a positioned element
does by painting order; UIKit/AppKit: brought to front). It receives no input
(`inert` / `isUserInteractionEnabled=false` / `routeInert`), is hidden from
accessibility (`aria-hidden` / `accessibilityElementsHidden` /
`setAccessibilityHidden`), gives up focus, and on the web loses every `id`
attribute in its subtree. On Apple it and its descendants leave the
presenter's maps, so focus-by-id and every other lookup find only the live
node; a node re-created with the same key while the ghost leaves is a new
view with a new id (runner ids never repeat). The ghost is removed when its
animations end, or at once when its parent is destroyed. On the web it also takes `transition: none` first, so an authored
`transition: all` cannot animate its switch to an absolute box (a transition
still running on it ends where it was going).

**D5 — Native exits run on the engine.** The Apple host withholds the
ghost's and its descendants' destroys, spares its motion node from the
commit's removals, and calls `Engine::play_exit` at the commit's clock. As a browser appends a
list's entry, the exit follows the animations the node already plays, which
keep running (a spinner fades while it spins), and composites over them; an
exit naming keyframes the node already plays is a second entry and starts
now. Only the exit's end is waited for. The web does the same: the exit's
CSS `animation` list is appended to the element's own, and the ghost is
removed when the appended animations end.
`settle_time` includes its end, so `clock settle` waits for it; when the
engine passes the end, one `destroy` of the ghost lets the presenter drop the
whole subtree. The presenter needs one new op (`exit`) and one new `present`
property (`layout`). Since the merge with main's Core Animation executor (LLP 1055 D7), a
leaving node's animations are the engine's from its exit on: the host marks
it sampled and hands its lowered ones back (`animations` with none), so
what it already played keeps running under the same clock as the exit.

**D6 — Layout moves by an offset; size moves the surface alone.** Natively
a node with the row has its laid-out box observed as `Property::Layout` (four
components: origin in its parent, width, height; `Kernel::layout_box`) after
each layout that moved or resized it; the engine's transition rules give
first seen, interruption from the current presentation and springs (settling
per axis in points) for free. The presenter gets `layout` as the shown box's
offset from the laid-out origin, applied outermost as a translation (it
composes with authored `translate`/`scale`/`rotate`, and a moving parent
carries its children: only relative motion animates), and its size as a
ratio of the laid-out one. The size is the box's *surface* only, as a UIKit
or SwiftUI frame animation shows it: its background, border, radius, shadow
and — when it clips — the clip on its children take the shown size from the
top-left corner, while the view keeps its laid-out frame, so its content and
children stay at their final geometry and move only by their own
transitions. A growing card reveals its body under its title; nothing is
ever scaled, and nothing is laid out per frame. On Apple a `SurfaceLayer`
under everything the node holds paints the surface (Core Animation's own
properties where they can say the box, else drawn as the node draws it)
while the node paints none, and a clipping node's clip becomes a mask of the
shown box (`Surface.swift`); Linux paints the box at the shown size and
clips children to it (`Presented::surface`). On the web `presence-glue.js`
measures every declaring element before and after each batch, sub-pixel and
transform-free: its bounding rect with its own transforms taken off through
its computed style, and its ancestors' 2D maps (rotation and skew included)
undone; plays a move as an additive (`composite: "add"`) `translate`,
residual and velocity included on interrupt; and plays a size change on a
stand-in behind the element — the element's background, border, radius,
shadow and own transforms on an absolutely placed box inside a zero-size
anchor before it, sized by keyframes, with the element's own surface
transparent and its children clipped by an animated `clip-path: inset()`
when it clips. A spring is lowered by the module per move from its
displacement and velocity in points, on the engine's 240 Hz grid and rest
threshold, so both settle at the same time. A windowed list's row root is
placed in the list content, not its wrapper (which only positions it), so
rows slide when one leaves. A resize takes new boxes without animating
(native and web alike: the web never measures a resize).

**D7 — The web loads it after paint.** Rows travel as custom properties in
the node's `cssText` (`--exact-exit-animation`, `--exact-layout-transition`);
the exit's `@keyframes` rule is sent while its node lives. `glue.js` loads
`presence-glue.js` the first time a batch carries either, so boot is
unchanged (`boot.mjs` counts the same graph). A batch with an exit that
arrives while it loads waits for it, with every batch after it in order
(`presenceLoader`, navigation.js), so no exit is lost. An `exit` op carries
the CSS list it plays: a windowed row's wrapper declares none.

**D8 — Linux is honest.** Layout transitions run (the offset and scale are
painted outermost, as on Apple). Exit animation is refused: the painter draws the
live kernel tree every frame, and keeping a destroyed subtree would need a
retained paint list that does not exist. The node leaves at once and the
journal records `exit-animation: refused on Linux (LLP 1063)` the first time.

**D9 — A row gained is a transition gained.** A node that gains
`layout-transition` in a commit starts from the box it had before that
commit's layout, so its first move animates, as a CSS transition declared in
the same style change runs (Apple and Linux seed the engine before layout; the
web measures a node a batch's `style` op gives the row).

**Not a gap — route and screen pops.** A popped screen leaves under its
platform's transition: UIKit's pop slides the controller away (a button's pop
over a frozen snapshot of its outgoing pixels, an interactive one over live
views), and the web swaps route content as a history navigation. The route
node is the destroyed subtree's root, so its content's exits are nested exits
and do not play; playing them would be invisible under the snapshot or fight
the slide. A route node's own `exit-animation` is the author's way to animate
a leaving screen where the platform does not.

## Verified

- `motion/tests/it/presence.rs`, `kernel/tests/it/presence.rs`,
  `contract/cli/tests/it/presence.rs`, `host/{apple,linux,web}/tests/it/presence.rs`,
  `host/linux/src/paint/presented.rs` (the painted box), the Linux pixel test
  (a growing card, clipping and not: its title keeps all its rows, its
  surface is the shown height, its body revealed only as it clips), and the
  XCTests `PresenceIOSTests`/`PresenceMacTests` (the presenters' `exit`,
  `destroy` and `layout` ops; the surface at the shown size, the node's own
  off, the clip a mask, a drawn surface upright).
- iOS simulator (UIKit presenter, `scripts/agent.mjs ios`, the same cases):
  at 150 ms the exit plays over the node's still-running spin while the
  accordion card grows from its old size and the node that gained the row
  slides; `clock settle` lands at 720.83 ms, the spring's settle for its 18
  point move, the same as the web's.
- iOS simulator, after the surface change: mid-grow and mid-shrink, every
  card's title at full size; a clipping, rounded, shadowed card's surface and
  clip at the shown height with its body revealed under it; a card with a
  red top and blue bottom border (a drawn surface) upright at the shown size.
- Headless Chrome (an outside app with every case, driven over CDP): an exit
  appended after a spinning node's infinite `animation`, which keeps its time,
  with `transition: all` and no transition started; a spring slide lowered to
  721 ms for 18 points, as `SpringConfig::settle_time` gives natively; a
  clipping, rounded, bordered, shadowed card growing 34 → 154 points: at
  mid-time its title still 18 high, its stand-in 94 high with the card's
  background, radius, border and shadow while the card paints none, its body
  clipped by `inset(0 0 60px round 12px)`, all gone at the end; shrinking
  back, the surface shrinks over its content; a node in a container turned
  90° moving by its own 30 points (the old measure swapped the axes); a
  node gaining the row moving 37.39 points (sub-pixel) from its old place; a
  windowed row leaving as its wrapper while the row below slides 40 points;
  the presence module's fetch held while an exit arrives: the batch waits and
  the exit plays when it lands.
- macOS: `PresenceMacTests` only; the app was not driven after these changes.

## Known gaps

- Web: the stand-in paints below all of its parent's in-flow content
  (`z-index: -1` in the parent, isolated for the while), so an earlier
  sibling's content that overflows onto a box whose size is moving shows over
  that box's surface, where CSS and the native hosts paint the surface above
  an earlier sibling's backgrounds. Painting it in tree order needs an
  in-flow box, which a flex `gap` or grid would lay out.
