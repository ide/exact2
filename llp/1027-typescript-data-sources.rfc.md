# LLP 1027: TypeScript data sources — app logic in TS, behind the one seam

**Type:** RFC
**Status:** Accepted (Charlie, 2026-09-03 — "accept all recs": every §10 leaning and every §8 trade as written, with the rulings recorded inline the same day: Rolldown (Q1), `console` (Q2), 1.8 MB given optional (Q3), the lean VM at bake (Q4), Caltrain stays Rust (Q5), the pure tier as ibex2's Rust bindings (Q9), `fetch` as the normal thing (Q8), iOS numbers not a blocker (Q7). **Implementer: Claude (Fable 5.1). Date: 2026-09-03**, stage 1 begun the same day — §9.)
**Systems:** Runner (a second `DataSource` executor: the app's logic as a TypeScript module, compiled to Hermes bytecode, run by the lean VM), Contract (unchanged above the seam; a generated `app.d.ts` below it), Build (bake compiles TypeScript to bytecode and to page JavaScript, and evaluates constant resources through the same engine), Web host (the browser is the executor; the module loads after first paint through one wasm import), Apple host and Linux host (link `exact-js`, a separate crate, after first pixel), Delivery (LLP 1026's `module` card carries bytecode; the runtime version gains the bytecode version), ibex (what exact2 links from it, and what it never links — Charlie's "split it in two" question, answered as three)

External: Hermes (`facebook/hermes` 260318099.0.0-stable, the vanilla build in `~/projects/ibex/ios/Frameworks-vanilla/`, receipt `hermes-input-receipt.json`; `hermesvmlean` is the bytecode-only VM), the App Store's interpreted-code clause (the one Expo Updates lives under; a JIT is impossible on iOS and Hermes has none). Predecessor, research never authority: exact1 LLP 0517 (the wasm host interface and its TypeScript provider seam: `callSync`, one argument envelope, "a provider adapter MUST NOT construct/evaluate source text per call" — the same shape, reached from the other side), LLP 0508 §9 (`resource` in Contract), exact1's `data.ts` (202 lines — what LLP 1004 §4 rewrote into Rust; §3 here says why it can come back).

**Accepted amendment (2026-09-04):** [LLP 1027.000](1027.000-explicit-time-and-randomness.rfc.md)
addresses the stage-3 clock gap and implicit randomness, including bake and
cache semantics. Charlie requested the described fixes on 2026-09-04:
explicit time/seed arguments and refusal of ambient reads replace D1a's
unimplemented clock shadow. The macOS executor implementation and actual
verification are recorded in the child; browser parity and iOS execution are
recorded in D6 (2026-09-07).

**Proposed amendment (2026-09-26, built on `perf/adopt`, awaiting Charlie):**
D11 — a source may adopt the compiled value the runner already holds for
its query, so an app keeps its list data once, not twice.

**Tooling runtime (Charlie, 2026-09-14):** Bun replaces Node for the bake and
repository scripts. Rolldown remains the app bundler, and `hermesc` remains the
bytecode compiler; the resident producer and existing dev server retain their behavior.

## Summary

Charlie's ruling, 2026-09-03, in his words: *"we want TS support to be
optional but to be the default paved path for anything with substantial
app logic/business logic."* And, the same hour: *"maybe we want the
stdlib from ibex2 (stuff like fetch etc) to be available to rust? So
maybe ibex2 needs to be sort of split into 2 so you can have the rust
stdlib and you can have the Hermes/TS support and choose to include
either of those?"*

This document is the design for the first and the answer to the
second. It changes nothing above the data seam. A Contract app still
declares `resource`, `send`, `mutation`, and `shape`; the runner still
asks one `DataSource` and refuses anything not in the declared shape
(LLP 1004 D4, LLP 1005 §3). What changes is what may sit behind that
seam: **a TypeScript module**, compiled at bake to Hermes bytecode for
native hosts and to plain JavaScript for the web, loaded after first
pixel on every host, run by the lean Hermes VM through a new crate,
`exact-js`, that a host links or does not. The Rust data crate stays,
for compute and for apps that want it, behind the same seam; an app
may have both (D8).

**The seam in TypeScript** is four exports — `appId`, `grants`,
`answer(source, args, store)`, `parse(source, args, outcome, store)` —
with values as JSON and the plan's own shapes directing the conversion
both ways (D1, D2). No `fetch`, no timers, no filesystem: the module
has no globals that reach outside the process, so a request is a value
the host runs under the grants, exactly as in Rust (LLP 1016 D1). That
is not discipline; it is the absence of a binding.

**Measured on this Mac (§5), with a probe that ports Caltrain's data
crate to TypeScript line for line and drives both through the seam:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Answers, all twenty cases including six error paths | **byte-identical** to the native crate |
| The module | 9.8 KB TypeScript → 6.0 KB JavaScript → **11.1 KB bytecode**, in **20 ms** |
| Runtime create · bytecode load (p50 of 20) | **0.32 ms · 0.008 ms** |
| One call through the seam, JSON both ways (p50 of 2000) | **1.2–41 µs**, against 0.04–5.5 µs native: **7.5–29×** |
| The lean engine, linked and stripped, on macOS arm64 | **+1.81 MB** (+785 KB gzipped); wasmi was +1.0 MB (LLP 1026 §5) |
| `tsc --strict` on the module | 0.43 s, clean |

**What it reverses and what it keeps.** LLP 1004 D4 rejected a
TypeScript seam on a three-part bill: an engine in every native host, a
baked first frame, and staleness machinery for values that arrive
late. The second and third have since been built as ordinary features
(bake, LLP 1016's settlement). The remaining item is the engine, and it
is 1.8 MB, once, after first pixel. The 2026-08-29 ruling — "zero app
JS until a measured call site" — is superseded by Charlie's of
2026-09-03; the "design that first" it asked for is D6. Kept, to the
letter: no app JS before first pixel (D4), the boot path compiles
nothing (D5: bytecode, compiled at bake), one authoring model for the
UI (Contract; §7 refuses JS above the seam), and the React door.

**ibex, in three, not two (D9).** The split Charlie asked about already
exists: `ibex2::host` is the Rust standard library with no engine, and
exact2's hosts link it today. What a TypeScript data source needs is
not ibex2's JavaScript runtime — the ESM loader, the `fetch` binding,
the task queue — because the module is a function with no I/O, not a
program. It needs the **engine build**: the lean VM, `hermesc`, and the
receipt that binds them, per platform. So: the standard library
(linked by hosts, today), the engine as a `-sys`-shaped crate (linked
by `exact-js`, proposed), and ibex2's runtime layer on top of the
engine (never linked by exact2). The probe in §11 is the proof: ~100
lines of C++ against the vanilla headers, nothing from ibex2.

This is a proposal with no implementer and no date. §8 names the
trades; §10 asks what only Charlie can answer.

## 1. The ruling, and the question it settles

Three questions were asked on 2026-09-03 in this order, and the
answers are this document's premises:

1. *Can an app write Rust today, or only Contract?* Rust, in three
   places: the data crate (Caltrain's schedule model; Weird Castle's
   `loginV2`, its token book in the store, its account switcher), the
   GPU surfaces (`apps/caltrain/gpu`, wgpu), and native modules (LLP
   1024, Rust and Swift). Contract is the UI and its state machine,
   and §2 lists what it cannot do, on purpose.
2. *Wouldn't substantial logic want TypeScript rather than Rust?* Yes,
   for the reason that matters and not for the one usually given. §3.
3. *Optional, but the default paved path for substantial logic.* The
   ruling. This document does not re-argue it; it builds it, and §8
   records the trades a ruling owes.

What "paved path" means here, concretely: an app is `app.contract`
beside `app.ts`, and that is the whole app until it needs something a
`.ts` cannot be (D8, D10). The Rust crate is the same seam with a
different file, chosen when the logic is hot or when the app is the
runtime's own fixture. Neither is a second UI.

## 2. What Contract cannot do, by design

LLP 1006 §2 says what Contract is. This is the complement, so the
boundary this document draws is visible from both sides. Each is LLP
1004 D4's choice — "computation enters at one place" — not a gap:

- **No list or record literals, and no list operations.** No map,
  filter, sort, reduce, index, or slice. Every list and record comes
  from a resource or a mutation; an `each` under a `when` filters what
  is *shown*, never what is *computed*.
- **Expressions are small.** Arithmetic, comparison, boolean logic,
  ternary, templates, field access, option match, and the roster's
  eleven entries (stdlib.rs:14–56: four formatters, `length`,
  `isEmpty`, `toString`, `floor`, `max`, `min`, `now`). No string
  splitting or case changes, no date parsing, no regular expressions,
  no JSON.
- **Actions branch but never loop:** assignments, `send`, `refresh`,
  capability commands, `if`/`match` (LLP 1017 P2). No `let`, no
  `await`, no second request chained off a reply inside one action.
- **A `fn` is one expression**, inlined, non-recursive (LLP 1017 P5):
  "the first `fn` that wants a loop is evidence for the data crate."
- **Only the root** holds resources, mutations, and tasks; the one
  task form is a repeating timer.
- **No I/O.** Contract names a source; the source decides the request;
  the host runs it under grants (LLP 1016). Contract cannot fetch,
  read a file, touch a secret, or call a platform API.

Everything on that list is what "substantial app logic" is made of.
Under LLP 1004 D4 it lives in Rust. Under this document it lives in
TypeScript by default, behind the same seam, and the list above does
not change by one line: the seam is what keeps Contract small.

## 3. Why TypeScript for logic — the honest version

The argument that is right: **logic that shapes data wants
TypeScript.** Parsing replies, string and date handling, flows, state
machines, JSON in and out — Rust charges the type system and the
borrow checker for code that needed neither. For agents this is
larger still: TypeScript is the language they write best, and a fix
loop that includes borrow-checker rounds is a slower loop. The edit
loop compounds it: `bun build` plus `hermesc` is **20 ms** for the
probe's module (§5) at any size a data module will reach, while a
Rust leaf crate rebuilds in seconds and grows.

The argument that is backwards: **binaries do not get big because of
Rust logic.** The whole Caltrain web app — runner, kernel, data crate,
plan — is 513 KiB of wasm, 215 KiB gzipped (`metrics.mjs`,
2026-09-03). Logic in Rust compiles to roughly the size of its
bytecode. What makes a binary big is the engine, a fixed cost paid
before the first line of TypeScript: **1.81 MB** stripped for the lean
VM (§5). One pays it once, and every app on the paved path gets
TypeScript for it; but it is the engine's cost, not Rust's absence.

The part of "a lot of logic" that still wants Rust: **the hot part.**
Hermes is an interpreter — no JIT anywhere, and none possible on iOS
— and the probe's per-call tax is 7.5–29× on calls that cost
microseconds natively (§5). Search over a large list, geometry,
diffing, anything per-item and per-frame, is Rust's; D8 lets an app
say so per source. The split is by kind of work, not by amount.

So the paved path is TypeScript because of who writes the logic and
how fast the loop runs, with Rust one file away for the same seam when
a source is hot. That is the ruling's shape, and the rest of this
document is its mechanism.

## 4. Design

### D1 — The module: four exports, the seam as JSON, no globals that reach out

An app on the paved path has `app.ts` beside `app.contract`. Its
entry evaluates to one object on `globalThis.exact` (what the bundler
emits for a module's exports; the name is the executor's to look up):

```ts
export const appId = "xyz.castle.weird";                      // LLP 1023 D5
export const grants = "net.fetch https://api.castle.xyz\nsecret.keep castle.session\n";

export function answer(source: string, args: Args, store: Store): Answer { … }
export function parse(source: string, args: Args, outcome: Outcome, store: Store): Answer { … }
```

with the seam's types, generated per app (D5) from the Contract's
`shape` declarations and its `resource`/`send` declarations:

```ts
type Answer = { value: unknown } | { request: Request } | { error: DataError };
type Request = { method: string; url: string; headers: [string, string][]; body: string };
type Outcome = { response: { status: number; headers: [string, string][]; body: string } }
             | { failed: { kind: "Network" | "Refused" | "Unsupported" | "Aborted"; message: string } };
type DataError = { kind: "UnknownSource" | "BadArguments" | "Unavailable"; message: string };
interface Store { get(name: string): string | null; set(name: string, value: string): void; forget(name: string): void; }
```

That is the trait (runner.rs:23–79) with each Rust type given its
JSON spelling; nothing is added and nothing is dropped. `answer`
returns now, or a request, or an error; `parse` turns what the host
brought back into the declared shape, or an error; the store is the
one thing either may write (LLP 1018 D5), and a write outside the
grants is refused by the executor exactly as `Store::set` refuses it
today (store.rs:111). Weird Castle's login, from the probe (§11),
which is the whole shape of a request-answering source:

```ts
case "login": {
  const who = text(args, 0).trim(), password = text(args, 1);
  if (who === "" || password === "") return { value: { ok: false, username: "", error: "Enter a username and a password" } };
  return { request: { method: "POST", url: "https://api.castle.xyz/graphql",
                      headers: [["content-type", "application/json"]],
                      body: JSON.stringify({ query: LOGIN, variables: { who, password } }) } };
}
// …and in parse:
const user = json?.data?.loginV2;
if (user?.token) { store.set("castle.session", …); return { value: { ok: true, username: user.username, error: "" } }; }
return { value: { ok: false, username: "", error: json?.errors?.[0]?.message ?? `Login failed (HTTP ${status})` } };
```

**The module has no I/O because it has no bindings.** The executor
creates a runtime with `eval` closed and installs nothing: no `fetch`,
no timers, no `console` unless D10 admits it, no filesystem, no
`URL`. A module that reaches for one throws a `ReferenceError` at the
call, which the executor reports as `DataError::Unavailable` naming
the source — the LLP 1026 D3 discipline ("not 'the data crate does no
I/O' but 'the data crate *cannot*'"), here by the emptier mechanism of
an empty global object. A request is how it reaches out, and the host
runs it under the grants (LLP 1016 D6) on every host, before any
executor sees it.

**Synchronous, on purpose.** `answer` and `parse` return values, never
promises: there is nothing to await, because I/O is a request the
host runs and the reply comes back through `parse` (LLP 1016 D1). An
`async` seam function returns a `Promise`, which the executor refuses
as `Unavailable("answer returned a promise")` — the same refusal
exact1's LLP 0517 spelled as "a provider adapter MUST NOT …", reached
from the other side. Inside the module, `async` is simply pointless.

**One entry, bundled.** Hermes runs scripts, not ES modules. `app.ts`
may import other `.ts` files and packages; the bake bundles them to
one script (D5). A package is admissible exactly when it bundles to
code with no reaching-out global — the bundler does not know, the
type check does not know, the call does: `ReferenceError`, refused by
name at the first call, which the fixture drives at bake (D5).

### D1a — `fetch` as the normal thing (proposed 2026-09-03, recommended)

Charlie, the same day: *"there is so much training data where authoring
involves calling fetch from ts, etc. maybe we should just make it the
normal thing?"* Yes, and it costs less than D1's purity suggested,
because the host already owns the request machinery:

- **`fetch(url, init)` is a binding that does no I/O.** It checks the
  grants in Rust at the boundary, hands the request to the host's
  ticket-and-fulfill path (LLP 1016 D2 — `exact_fulfill`, abi.rs:296;
  the page's grant-checked `fetch` at glue.js:358–384; ibex2's `fetch`
  on native), and returns a Promise the executor resolves when the host
  fulfills. The runner still never does I/O; every request still
  crosses the one Rust boundary; the agent still sees every request.
- **`answer` may return a value or a `Promise` of one.** A Promise is
  "pending" exactly as `Answer::Later` is; when it settles, the value
  takes D2's shape check. For TypeScript modules `parse` is gone — the
  continuation is the code after `await`. The Rust seam keeps
  `Later`/`parse`; a Rust source has no engine to hold a continuation.
- **Sequential requests** inside one action — which neither Contract
  (§2) nor today's seam can express — become `await` lines.
- **The web** shadows `fetch` with the page's grant-checked path rather
  than the browser's own — which closes D6's globals asymmetry better
  than deleting globals does.
- **The executor gains:** one Promise-returning binding; a `Response`
  with `status`, `headers`, `text()`, `json()`, `arrayBuffer()`;
  draining the microtask queue after each fulfill (the lean VM has the
  queue; ibex2's `fetch.js` binding and task pump are this, written);
  a re-request while an answer is in flight lets the old Promise run
  out and drops its result by ticket, as a stale reply is dropped today.
- **What stays out:** timers, and an ambient clock or random generator.
  LLP 1027.000 (accepted and implemented 2026-09-04) replaces the proposed
  `Date.now` shadow with explicit time/seed arguments and clear refusal of
  ambient reads before module initialization and after asynchronous work.
  `AbortSignal` has its trigger.
- **Bake** treats a constant resource whose `answer` returns a Promise
  as it treats a store-reading one: no compiled value, answered on the
  device after first pixel (D4).

D1's "no bindings" becomes "no binding that reaches *past the host*":
`fetch` reaches the host, which is where it reached before.

**As built (stage 3, 2026-09-03).** The seam from the module's side is
`exact.answer(source, args, store)` returning the value or a Promise of
it and throwing for a refusal (an object with `kind` and `message`);
`fetch`, `Headers`, `Response`, and `store` come from a prelude
(`js/src/prelude.js`, bytecode, evaluated before the module) that
reaches Rust through one host function with four ops — record a
request, store get, set, forget — so a store read is counted and a
write grant-checked by the runner's own `Store`. The executor calls
three prelude functions: `__exact_call(source, argsJson)` (a value, a
refusal, or "pending: drain and settle"), `__exact_settle(id)` (the
value, the refusal, or the ticket of the fetch the answer awaits), and
`__exact_fulfill(ticket, outcomeJson)` (resolves that fetch; the
continuation runs in the microtask drain that follows). **The runner's
`parse` now returns an `Answer`**, so a reply may hand back one more
request on the same target with the same arguments — the runner
enqueues it under a new ticket and commits nothing else — which is how
one `answer` awaits two fetches in a row; every Rust source wraps its
value in `Answer::Now`. `query` (the bake's path) has no store — reads
are empty, writes refused — and a fetching answer is `Unavailable`
there, exactly as `Later` at boot is refused today. LLP 1027.001 now binds
Ibex URL, UTF-8 text and base64 in native TS. `Headers` retains the existing
adapter; broader encodings and `AbortSignal` remain separate gaps.
The clock gap was closed by LLP 1027.000 on
2026-09-04 with explicit time/seed arguments and ambient-read refusal.

**As built (2026-09-23): a parked call is keyed by its target.** Source
and arguments are not a call's identity: two targets can ask one source with
equal arguments, and the second `answer` used to drop the first call, whose
reply then resumed the second while the first never settled. The runner
keeps one request in flight per target (LLP 1016 D5) and asks through
`answer_for`/`parse_for`, which name it (`Target::Resource(i)` or
`Target::Mutation(i)`) and default to `answer`/`parse`. `exact-js`, the web
module and both of its realms, and `Mixed` and `Placed`'s stage queues key a
parked call by target, then source and arguments; a source that forwards to
another forwards the target too. A caller that names no target (a forwarder
that overrides only `answer`/`parse`) keeps the old key and behavior. A
replaced Rust module's byte seam carries no target; a Rust source parks
nothing between `answer` and `parse`. After a commit that let a request go
(newer arguments, an answer now, an assignment, a refused commit), the
runner tells the source what is still in flight (`forgotten`, after any
restore), and each of those executors drops the calls it parked for
anything else: the prelude's record and fetches too, a realm's queued turns,
and a Mixed set's reservation for a turn whose reply the runner will drop.
Each in-flight request names the continuation token its source handed out
(`InFlight`), which is what tells a `refresh`'s call from the one it replaced
when their arguments are equal; `Storage`, `Mixed` and `Placed` hand their
child its own tokens. A Mixed set lets its reserved turn go when the turn's
key is gone or its request is a newer call recorded there, and a key whose
request is such a call keeps only that call's stage.

### D2 — Marshaling is shape-directed, both ways, from the plan's own tables

Values cross as JSON, and the *plan* says what the JSON means: a
`resource … as shape T` and a `send … as shape T` name a type in the
plan's `types` table, whose record rows carry named fields in order
(`plan.fields`, builder.rs:178–191). So the executor converts without
guessing:

| Plan type | JSON out to the module | JSON in from the module |
|---|---|---|
| `number` | a finite number | a finite number; anything else refused |
| `string`, `bool` | as is | as is |
| `option<T>` | `null` or T | `null` or T |
| `list<T>` | an array | an array |
| a record (`shape`) | an object keyed by field name, in declared order | an object; every declared field present, none extra; converted in *declared* order into `Value::Record` |

Arguments go out the same way, typed by the declaration's argument
expressions (the type pass already typed them, LLP 1006 §2). The
result is decoded into a `Value` and then checked by `conforms`
(value.rs:88) exactly as a Rust answer is — the shape check at the
seam is unchanged, and it is the second line of defense behind the
conversion. A malformed reply is `DataError::Unavailable` naming the
source and the field; never a panic (LLP 1005 §2's refusal
discipline).

LLP 1027.001 D5 now carries large native result strings separately alongside
their JSON message, after Fieldnotes demonstrated a multi-megabyte escaping and
parsing cost. The built-in serializer and existing shape validation retain their
semantics; app exports, the module ABI and the browser path do not change.

As built (2026-09-24, LLP 1047 §6): the JSON on both paths is
`exact_js_value::json`, one reader and writer without serde. It keeps serde_json
1.0's grammar, errors and their positions, sorted object keys and last duplicate
wins, except that a number with a fraction or an exponent is read correctly
rounded (`exact-num`), so a value JavaScript wrote arrives as exactly its value.
serde_json's reader misread 23.7% of shortest round-trip double texts (17.9% in
`JSON.stringify`'s decimal range) by an ulp or two, and overflowed
`1.7976931348623158e308`, which is `f64::MAX`. The web wasm links neither serde
nor serde_json.

Why JSON and not a walk over the engine's objects through JSI: the
walk would be faster (the probe's per-call cost is mostly the two
JSON passes, §5), and it is an optimization the executor can make
later behind the same seam. JSON first because the *web* executor
(D6) crosses a wasm boundary where JSON is the only sane shape, and
one marshaling on three hosts is worth more than microseconds on two.
The ABI is versioned by number, as LLP 1026 D3's is; `exact_abi` is
the module's fifth export, set by the generated types file (D5), and a
mismatch is refused by number.

The store crosses as a snapshot in and writes out: the executor hands
`answer` an object over the snapshot (`get`/`set`/`forget` recording
into a list), and after the call applies the recorded writes to the
runner's `Store` — where the grant check lives — so the module cannot
write what the crate could not (LLP 1018 D3). Pure in, pure out, the
LLP 1026 D3 shape.

### D3 — The executor: `exact-js`, a separate crate, the lean VM, and about a hundred lines of C++

`exact-js` implements `DataSource` for a bytecode module: `Module::new(hbc: &'static [u8])`
creates a runtime (`RuntimeConfig` with `eval` off and the microtask
queue on — ibex2's choice, hermes_shim.cc:120–131), evaluates the
bytecode once, reads `appId` and `grants` once, and answers
`query`/`answer`/`parse` through three calls: look up
`exact.answer`, call it with strings, read the string back. The
probe's `shim.cc` (§11) is that executor's C++ in full: `probe_create`,
`probe_load`, `probe_call`, `probe_string`, `probe_free`,
`probe_destroy`. An app's host crate says

```rust
exact_apple::host!(exact_js::Module, PLAN);     // instead of caltrain_data::Caltrain
```

with the module's bytes `include_bytes!`'d beside the plan — the host
macros and `Runner::boot` are generic over `D: DataSource` today and
do not change.

**A crate, never a feature.** `exact-js` depends on `exact-runner`
for the trait and on the engine build (D9) and nothing else; a host
links it or does not (LLP 1000's "another executor" clause; the
optional-capability rule in `CLAUDE.md`; Charlie, 2026-09-03: "JS engine
should be optional" — ruled). It is not a cargo feature
on `exact-runner`, `exact-apple`, or `exact-linux`, so there is no
build matrix, and a Rust-only app's binary contains no engine — the
"optional" half of the ruling, by construction.

**The lean VM.** `libhermesvmlean_a.a` is Hermes without its
compiler: it runs bytecode and refuses source. That is the shipping
shape under `rules/RULES.md` ("modules ship as bytecode, never source
strings transpiled per module at boot"), and it is what §5 measured:
the linked, dead-stripped engine is 1.81 MB against the full VM's
2.79 MB of text. A runtime that cannot compile cannot be handed source
by anyone, which closes the door exact1's Hermes path left open.

**Determinism.** Time and seed inputs are arguments, as for the Rust crate
(`board(id, dir, nowMs)`); LLP 1027.000 enforces that boundary in the existing
macOS/browser executors. Repeated inputs and supplied external outcomes reproduce
answers in the fixture. This does not claim cross-host locale/timezone
parity. The browser shares the guard corpus; iOS shares the prelude but has
only the application execution proof below. Linux execution remains unbuilt.

### D4 — After first pixel, on every host, and one frame of `pending`

`rules/RULES.md`: *no app JS before first pixel*, a **[check]** on the
web (`boot.mjs` counts the module graph reachable before first paint)
and a review rule elsewhere. This document keeps it to the letter, and
the way it does so is the one behavioral difference between a
TypeScript source and a Rust one:

- **The first frame is compiled data.** Bake evaluates every resource
  whose arguments are constant and that does not read the store (LLP
  1018 D4, cli/src/lib.rs:450–476), through the module (D5), and
  writes the values into the plan. The first frame needs no executor.
- **The executor is created after the first pixel** — on Apple and
  Linux in the slot the GPU module and native modules use (LLP 1009
  D2, LLP 1024 D3: after the paint gate), on the web by the same
  `requestAnimationFrame` that loads `gpu-glue.js` (glue.js:797–849).
  It costs 0.33 ms (§5).
- **A resource the bake could not answer** — one that reads the store,
  Weird Castle's `remember()` — is `pending` until the executor
  arrives: one frame, under a millisecond on native. LLP 1016 already
  gives the app `pending(x)` and an `option` for exactly this shape;
  no new state appears. A Rust crate answers such a resource
  synchronously at boot today; the TypeScript one answers it a frame
  later. That is the price of the rule, stated.

**As ruled and built (2026-09-03, "ok let's do that").** Building stage 5
showed the frame was not the only cost: a store-reading resource
(Weird Castle's `remember()`) is *answered at boot*, and a runner whose
source is not ready cannot answer it at all — boot would fail. The data
such an answer needs is one store entry and its result is a fifty-byte
record, so the runner now **keeps the answer**: the last fresh value of
every store-reading resource is written beside the app's secrets under
`exact.kept.<resource>` (arguments and value, canonical bytes; never
granted to the app, never counted as a read, never a revision; capped at
8 KB), persisted by the host like any store write. At a boot whose source
is not ready (`DataSource::ready`, false for an unloaded module) the
first frame shows the kept answer if its arguments still match and its
value still fits, else the compiled **empty-store placeholder** the bake
now writes for every reader (`resources.reader`, plan format 4; LLP 1018
D4 amended), and the host calls `Runner::data_ready()` after loading the
engine, which asks every placeholder-shown resource again in one commit.
A returning user sees "signed in" on the first frame; a fresh install sees
the empty-store frame, which is right for it; a keychain cleared underneath
shows the kept answer for one frame and is corrected. No JavaScript before
first pixel, no bend in the rule, and the shape every native app already
uses for cached login state. `js/tests/castle.rs` drives all three.

**Identifying arguments (LLP 1027.005, accepted 2026-10-02).** A declaration
`source(call, …) with context, …` sends all arguments to its source, and a
change to any argument asks again. Its kept entry contains only the call's
identifying arguments and the value, under the same 8 KB bound and encoding.
At a boot whose source is unready, that persisted entry may seed the first
frame only when its argument count and identifying values match and its
value fits the current shape. Without `with`, all arguments identify the
answer, with exactly the existing entry bytes. Runner-owned facts never
qualify. A boot-local mark preserves this exception through context changes
before readiness; an identity mismatch or committed activation consumes it,
and a refused commit restores it with the value. `data_ready` asks with the
latest full arguments. While that request is pending, the seed stays visible
but provisional: it is neither carried, checkpointed nor newly persisted.
Only a fresh valid answer from a successful commit is kept. Every other
comparison — live requests, pending tickets, failed arguments, reload carry,
document checkpoints and compiled values — keeps its full-argument rules.
A source already ready at boot receives no persisted seed. The default web
JS target keeps no answers; `with` there supplies ordinary trailing arguments
(LLP 1027.005 D5), and its document checkpoint retains full-argument adoption.

**Where Apple keeps them (2026-09-24).** "Beside the app's secrets" was
literal on Apple: the host's store held only the names the app granted, so
every kept write was refused (`store exact.kept.<resource> failed: denied:
secret.keep`) and a returning user never saw the kept frame there. The
Crew port found it (report D14). Apple now routes `exact.kept.*` to
`ibex2`'s kv store under the scope `exact.kept`, a file per answer read in
one listing at launch, and the app's own secrets stay in the Keychain
(`host/apple/src/store.rs`, `Platform`). The host adds that one kv grant
itself; the app still cannot read a kept answer. The web keeps them in
page storage as before; Linux keeps nothing.

**The JS target keeps them too (2026-10-04).** The web build is the JS
target (LLP 1071), which has no runner and had kept nothing: its data
module is bundled with the page, so every source is ready at boot, and a
returning user saw placeholders until the chained answers landed (Lexy,
WebKit: data at ~1.1 s, the status at ~2.1 s). `host/web-js/kept.js` keeps
them as the runner does — one `localStorage` entry a resource,
`exact.kept.<resource>`, holding its source's name, then its arguments and
value in the runner's encoding (canonical bytes, hex, `|`), refused over
8 KB; never the runner's facts; out of the app's reach — for a resource the
bake marked a reader or whose answer read the store. At boot a resource whose
kept answer's identifying arguments (before a `with`) equal its own, whose
value fits its shape and whose source is the same shows it on the first
frame; since the source is ready, it is asked at once as always and the
fresh answer replaces it (Lexy: last data on the first frame, ~50 ms, fresh
at ~1.1 s). The web's own rule beside it: a change to the store's set of
names (a secret kept that was absent, or forgotten: signing in or out,
leaving a demo) forgets every kept answer in that commit, so a reload never
paints another account's data; a rewritten secret (a refreshed token) does
not. Off under the agent and in a render, whose state is the drive's.

**Storage readers (2026-09-07):** the same `resources.reader` marker covers
filesystem and SQLite access. A storage call records an external read even when
bake refuses it; it does not invent a secret read or key. Storage-backed resources
therefore show their kept answer or baked placeholder on the first frame and
refresh through `data_ready()` after activation. Fieldnotes exercises this path:
a returning notebook opens its saved notes without a user action.

**Compiled answers are first frames (2026-10-04).** `data_ready` also asks
every resource that showed a compiled answer, even one whose arguments are
the bake's. Only an `else` row is not asked. The module at launch is not the
module the bake ran, and the web asks it at launch. Feed's no-argument
`explore()` stayed empty on macOS while the web filled it (LLP 1048.003 D6).

The alternative — create the engine before boot, since it is 0.3 ms —
was considered and not taken, not because the number is large but because the rule
is a count, not a timer, and the reason it is a count is that the
old repo's 5.47 MB of boot-path JavaScript began as a small number
too. If Charlie wants the frame back, it is a ruling on the rule, not
a change to this design (§10 Q3).

### D5 — Bake: TypeScript to bytecode and to JavaScript, constants through the same engine, types from the Contract

**Producer substep (Codex, 2026-09-06):** `contract types <app.contract>`
and `contract::typescript` now generate the source-to-argument/result map,
per-source providers, generic dispatcher, and store interface from the plan.
Use `-o app.contract.d.ts` beside `app.ts`: TypeScript resolves an adjacent
`app.d.ts` import back to `app.ts`, even with the declaration extension written.
The runner-owned `exactDelivery` source is excluded from app provider duties.
The pinned TypeScript compiler runs in the existing Cargo test suite: real
Caltrain signatures, sync/async providers and a cast-free dispatcher pass;
wrong results/arguments/store usage refuse. Malformed plans refuse, and a
Contract error leaves the CLI's last good output unchanged. These types
check annotated providers, not arbitrary unannotated JavaScript.

**Producer and native preparation (Codex, 2026-09-07):** `exact-js-bake`
captures app-local `app.ts`/Contract sources, generates those declarations,
runs the pinned TypeScript checker and Rolldown, compiles with `hermesc`, and
bakes through that HBC with an empty store. Rolldown is already in this repo's
toolchain; the Bun command below describes the original probe, not this producer.
Imports outside the captured app refuse; npm dependency capture remains owed.
As of 2026-09-13, the snapshot also carries `.ttf`/`.otf` fonts and every
regular file in the app’s `assets/`, `deck/`, and `gpu/shaders/` trees. This
keeps custom fonts and authored SVG/raster assets available during one-shot
and resident bakes. Existing capture size bounds and link refusals still apply;
web and Apple packagers continue to carry the static trees as bundle assets.
New output directories contain plan, JS, HBC and a pairing receipt (hashes,
lengths, ABI, bytecode version, identity, grants); no existing output is replaced.
This receipt is not an authenticated deployment receipt or a native bake receipt.

`Module` owns its admitted identity/grants and reports a bytecode hash to the
runner. Resource carry requires unchanged logic as well as matching arguments;
logic edits keep compatible slots, secrets and clock, but re-ask resources.
Apple's `exact_prepare_module` and `ExactGeneration.module` feed the existing
all-session prepare/commit path. A fresh session stays unloaded until its first
pixel. Painted replacements validate carried-state answers and layout in a
storage-free disposable engine, then prepare a fresh deferred engine seeded with
validated settled answers and the live store. Only committed activation configures
storage and refreshes external readers. This prevents both configuring an already
loaded module and executing candidate storage effects before all-session acceptance.
Normal Fieldnotes reload refreshes real SQLite data; agent mode creates no storage;
a refused candidate preserves the live app. The additional validation host has no
cold-boot cost. Rust-only clients,
mixed/corrupt bytes, changed grants/identity, and unsupported bytecode refuse.
New sessions receive the last accepted module rather than the binary's old one.
Module generations do not yet participate in signed update compositions.

Actual toolchain tests prove reproducibility, typed/runtime refusals, old-output
preservation, and two native Rust host sessions whose distinct carried state
makes one reject a candidate: neither session changes. The Swift coordinator
builds for macOS/iOS and both existing multi-session host smokes pass. A live
reload also preserves kept-answer persistence, exercised by the login fixture.
The URL/browser substep below proves a TypeScript UI edit on web/macOS;
D6 adds browser async parity and iOS simulator execution/replacement.

Bake gains three steps, all build-time, all reproducible:

1. **Bundle and strip.** `app.ts` and what it imports → one script,
   by `bun build --format=iife` (the toolchain the probe used; ibex2's
   own `typescript::strip` — Oxc — is the single-file fallback with no
   bundler in the loop; §10 Q1). 6 KB of JavaScript for the probe.
2. **Compile.** `hermesc -O -emit-binary` → `app.hbc`, 11 KB for the
   probe (as built since 2026-09-23 with `-emit-async-break-check` too,
   so a host can interrupt a running call; LLP 1048.000 D10), with the
   `hermesc` that ships beside the VM it targets (the
   receipt, D9): bytecode is version-coupled to the engine, and a
   mismatch is refused outright (ibex2 bytecode.rs). Steps 1–2: 20 ms.
3. **Evaluate constants.** `contract::bake(plan, exact_js::Module::new(&hbc))`
   — the same function, the same lean VM, the same bytecode the phone
   will run. LLP 1026 §10 Q7 asked whether bake should run the module
   through the interpreter so its boot values are provably the
   module's; for TypeScript there is no other way, so the question
   answers itself.

Two outputs from one source, as LLP 1026 D9 has it: `app.hbc` embedded
in the native binaries and named by the update bundle's `module` card
(D7); `app.js` — step 1's output, unminified — served to the web (D6).
The browser wasm embeds the module receipt and browser script, not native
bytecode. The web producer copies `app.hbc` from the actual Cargo bake output
and checks its digest and bytecode version against that embedded receipt before
publishing the paired files for native clients.

**The types are generated.** `contract` already knows every `shape`,
every resource's argument types, and every `send`'s; bake emits
`app.d.ts` beside the module: the `Args` per source as a
discriminated union, the `Answer` value type per source, the seam's
own types, and the ABI number. `tsc --noEmit --strict` against it
(0.43 s for the probe) is the module's type check, run by bake — part
of `build`, not a sixth check — so a module that answers `board` with
a `Station` is refused before the shape check at the seam ever sees
it. Generated files are built, never committed.

**The fixture is the same one.** The byte-equality test LLP 1026 D3
names as the ABI's fixture becomes this document's: Caltrain's Rust
crate and its TypeScript twin (§11) must answer the same bytes on
every source and every error path — twenty cases today. The Rust
crate stays as the Rust seam's fixture; the twin is the TypeScript
seam's; the test is one test.

**The dev loop (implemented 2026-09-07).** `dev.mjs` watches app-local
TypeScript/Contract/JSON and runs the producer into a private output directory.
Only a complete successful bake publishes a new immutable generation (1023
D2/D3); a logic edit does not send program-terminal `{rebuilt}`. The generation
binds plan, receipt, script, HBC and assets. Both clients restart with carry;
changed logic invalidates resource answers. A newer edit supersedes an older
in-flight bake; a refused bake leaves discovery unchanged. The ordinary Cargo
build scripts can call `exact_js_bake::build` to embed the same paired artifacts
and target receipt, currently for updater-free web/macOS/iOS compositions only.

The Apple adapters' explicit local `EXACT_DEV_PLAN` path and Reload menu also
load `app.module.json` and `app.hbc` beside the plan through paired acceptance.
They watch all three file identities and modification times: partial writes
keep the old app, and completion retries even if the plan itself is unchanged.
Native `--run` no longer implicitly watches the shared `host/web/dist/app.plan`;
live source edits use the dev server's `--url`, whose complete generations include
module-only edits. `EXACT_WEB_DIST` isolates that server's output when another app
is being built in the same checkout.

The development producer retains imported Rolldown and the native TypeScript
builder's private incremental cache across requests (`exact-js-bake <app> --serve`).
Each request captures the current source graph and runs full strict diagnostics;
bundling and HBC compilation overlap checking, but bytecode inspection and the bake
wait for checking to succeed. Resolved type-only imports must also stay inside the
capture or pinned standard libraries. An invalid, deleted or superseded input
cannot reuse a previous successful result. Both producer paths, and the web build
(calc F2, calendar F9: one configuration, `js/bake/src/typescript.mjs`), check the
full ES2023 and `WebWorker` standard libraries: data modules use web APIs, not DOM UI types
such as `Window`, `Document` or `HTMLElement`, which native hosts cannot support.
This is a cross-host type boundary, not a sandbox: the browser iframe can expose
additional globals incidentally, and ambient worker types grant no runtime API.
[TypeScript's library contexts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/lib.html)
separate these declarations without disabling diagnostics. The short-lived native
checker uses a larger GC growth target and a 128 MiB soft runtime-memory limit;
explicit Go environment settings override those development defaults.
Compiler overrides keep the one-shot invocation contract. Direct file watches
avoid delayed directory notifications; a bounded directory scan discovers additions
and replacements, and file identity/timestamps suppress duplicate notifications.
Logic edits reuse admitted static assets. Immutable development-cache payloads
are written completely before the envelope, without power-loss durability flushes
(1030.002 D2). Quota accounting reuses only the preceding successful completion
record; startup, foreign writers and failures force a full scan. Browser payloads
share one bounded fetch queue, with all integrity checks complete before acceptance.

Twenty real Fieldnotes logic edits measured 32 ms save-to-DOM acceptance,
34.5 ms to refreshed SQLite-backed content, and 49 ms to the next frame opportunity
(p95 50 ms), versus 436 ms refreshed-content median before these changes. This
local run meets the 40 ms content-update target and the 100 ms p50 budget;
next-frame timing remains above 40 ms and is not a compositor-paint measurement.
Timing starts before the source write; the first measured edit is included.
Draft carry, type-error refusal, latest-edit recovery, imported-file addition and
deletion, atomic replacement and subsequent edits passed. `scripts/metrics.mjs`
also recognizes the module producer and reports 20 visible Contract edits with
p50/p95 and next-frame timing; that generic metric is distinct from the Fieldnotes
SQLite-backed logic-edit drive.

Actual external counter clients at one URL changed their displayed answer with
count 1 retained on web/macOS, without rebuilding wasm or the native binary.
A candidate that bakes at count 0 but throws at count 1 preserved both running
apps. One browser producer-start-to-DOM sample was ~359 ms (producer 329 ms,
fetch 26 ms, restart 3 ms), excluding watch debounce; timing now includes it.
The repeated Fieldnotes measurements above supersede that one-off timing. D6 records the
subsequent async data parity, iOS simulator guard sweep and TypeScript Caltrain
UI drive, physical iOS guard execution and physical live-URL replacement;
signed module delivery remains owed.

#### D5 Windows captured-module paths (2026-10-04, implemented)

**Implementer:** Codex Windows lane, 2026-10-04. This is a bounded repair of
the existing producer containment check. Parent independently reviewed and
approved this scope before implementation, requiring absolute incoming IDs,
concrete regular-file admission and the real filesystem/refusal cases below.
It does not enable the Windows native JavaScript executor: `js/build.rs` still
leaves `ENGINE_LINKED=false` there. Producer tests returning at that guard are
not evidence of a linked Hermes runtime or successful native TypeScript bake.

On SDK `a73a3ae4a`, the actual no-Hermes one-shot and resident configuration
tests both refuse their captured `__exact_entry.ts`. The one-shot generated
Rolldown plugin tests `id.startsWith(process.cwd() + '/')`; Windows supplies
backslash file IDs. The first error uses the real short-name temporary path
`C:\\Users\\CHARLI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.exact-js-bake-…` and says
`module outside captured app`. The resident test first invokes that same
one-shot producer, so its failure does not yet establish a resident defect.
The captured-source names test separately expects slash-delimited strings
where its API returns `PathBuf`; that assertion should compare paths.

The proposed change shares one internal captured-module assertion from the
already shared `typescript.mjs` with the one-shot and resident Rolldown
plugins. It requires an absolute file ID, resolves both the stage and module
through the filesystem, and uses `node:path.relative` component containment:
refuse an absolute relative result, `..`, or a path beginning `..` plus the
platform separator. An empty result is not a module. This accepts a captured
file across separator, case and Windows short/long-name spellings without
accepting a sibling prefix or a link resolving outside the stage. Missing or
virtual modules still refuse. No fallback reads the uncaptured app, no output
is published on refusal, and no import authority, package resolution, native
runtime admission, compiler deadline or receipt format changes. The capture
remains producer-owned; this check does not introduce an adversarial-writer
filesystem sandbox or relax existing source-link refusal.

The first implementation check found that Bun's `realpathSync` preserves an
uppercase Unicode input spelling while `realpathSync.native` returns the
actual on-disk spelling; both sides therefore use the native operation before
component comparison. A resident fixture's fabricated origin paths also
mixed separators through `PathBuf::join("original/shared")`; host-native
component joins make that fixture match the producer's canonical origins.

Independent peer review identified that Windows `path.relative` folds case,
including in a case-sensitive directory. Parent reviewed and approved the
additional requirement that joining the canonical root and computed relative
path exactly reconstruct the canonical file. Alternate spelling must already
resolve to its real spelling; a distinct canonical sibling is not admitted.
The guard regression injects differing canonical prefix spellings to exercise
this condition; it is explicitly synthetic, not a case-sensitive NTFS claim.
An additional owned directory probe successfully enabled NTFS case sensitivity
with `fsutil`, created distinct `stage` and `STAGE` directories, and exercised
the actual helper: its own file was accepted and the case-only sibling's file
was refused. Only that ignored probe directory's attribute was changed.

Focused Windows qualification: all six library tests passed after the review
guard, including actual one-shot/resident bundling and byte agreement, config
invalidation/refusal/recovery, space/Unicode and casing aliases, and a real
junction escape. The preexisting Unix shell recovery test is now explicitly
Unix-only. The other 11 producer tests compiled and passed, but most return at
the unavailable native-engine guard; the ordinary web producer's real
TypeScript check and build did execute. The initial failure logs remain under
`target/upstream-a73/`. A separate existing `scripts/app.test.mjs` Cargo-graph
case uses a POSIX shell wrapper, colon PATH and Unix artifact suffixes; its
Windows trace assertion failed, while the five other focused metadata/receipt,
shader-pack, environment and deterministic-web flag tests passed. This is not a
claim that the complete JavaScript test suite or linked native JS is qualified.
Final independent code review approved the shared guard, both call sites and
the stated evidence limits. On this Windows checkout, the final default build
and 2,310 tests passed (54 existing ignores), default and affected producer
strict Clippy passed, caps and boot passed. All 164 workspace packages passed
format checking before the narrow change; both affected packages passed again
after it. The optional Contract differential check was attempted and refused
because `lake` is not installed; no Lean qualification is claimed.

After rebasing onto `80c52506c` (platform colours), the default build and
2,319 tests passed (54 existing ignores), default and native presenter strict
Clippy passed, all 164 packages passed formatting, and caps/boot passed.
The six actual producer library tests passed again. The rebuilt Contract CLI
resolved and compiled Skirmish's single source and Markdown's app plus package
source, with source maps. A focused native tint test passed with explicit CPU
painting. Its first run had mistakenly named `EXACT_PAINT` rather than
`EXACT_PAINTER`, so that successful Auto-painter run is not CPU-only evidence;
the corrected run is recorded separately under `target/upstream-80c/`.
The incoming colour schema changes its checked wire digest and bake identity;
old style modules must be rebuilt. Game EXSIM v7 is unchanged, and Skirmish
uses explicit text colours and no symbol tint. Native/browser game consumer
qualification against this newer SDK remains separate from this compiler fix.

The subsequent `f708c99cf` Contract-scope update was mistakenly rebased and
published with this fix before its combined qualification. No history was
rewritten and no frozen game SDK was changed. The combined default build and
2,327 tests passed; strict Windows lint found two unused variables in a new
alias-package fixture whose symlink and assertions were Unix-only. Marking the
whole fixture Unix-only removes its assertion-free Windows pass. The repaired
combined tree passed the repeated build, 2,326 tests (54 existing ignores),
strict default Clippy, formatting, caps and boot. Six actual JS-bake library
tests and strict producer lint also passed against `f708c99cf`. Rebuilt
Skirmish and Markdown plans were byte-identical to their `80c52506c` plans;
Markdown's actual graph reported its package and consulted manifest. These
results close that combined-code gate gap; Windows alias-symlink coverage and
actual newer-SDK game-host qualification are not inferred from them.

Qualification is the existing actual TypeScript/Rolldown no-Hermes tests in
both producer modes plus a bounded real-filesystem guard regression: nested
captured file accepted; sibling-prefix, parent traversal, missing/non-file ID
and outside target refused; Windows junction escape refused when the fixture
can create it, with any privilege limitation reported explicitly. Include a
space/Unicode stage and, where available, the actual short-name temporary
root. Keep the existing invalid-config/refusal/recovery checks and compare
produced script bytes between modes. The genuine Unix shell-wrapper producer
test remains Unix-only and is not claimed as Windows drain/recovery coverage.
Run the affected tests and strict lint, scoped formatting, then the repository
gates; retain the initial failure logs and the missing-Lean advice result.
No browser, GPU or native game launch is needed for this compiler-path repair.

### D6 — The web: the browser is the executor; one wasm import; the same module under two loaders

**Startup scrolling (2026-09-08).** Baked content remains scrollable and readable
while the deferred executor loads or fails. The web glue gates app event dispatch
and editing, rather than making the root `inert`. The private module iframe is
outside the presented tree; the host's iframe CSS applies only inside
`#exact-root`, so its `hidden` state cannot accidentally add a second page scroll
area. `js/web/tests/browser.rs` drives wheel, editing, activation, and failure in
Chrome and checks both private and presented iframe geometry.

**Implementation status (Codex, 2026-09-07):** `exact-js-web` and the private
browser loader support synchronous and async providers, including fetch.
Synchronous answers stay synchronous. A Promise becomes an executor-local
continuation request on the runner's existing ticket/fulfillment seam (1016
D1/D2); the browser drains microtasks at a MessageChannel task checkpoint,
without recursively entering wasm. Turns serialize within a realm, retaining
their original arguments and store context. Fetch describes an ordinary HTTP
request, run by the existing host transport with its grants and CORS policy.
Sequential requests and `Promise.all` work; multiple pending fetches use the
seam serially rather than promising concurrent network transport. Both native
and browser executors retain every outstanding request across settlements.
`clock settle` includes continuation work. Disposal removes queued turns and
refuses in-progress continuations; the host incarnation check drops stale
fulfillment. Browser trusted-code execution does not implement Hermes's heap
or interruption budgets; parity below is a tested data/guard surface, not a
claim that an iframe is a VM security boundary.

*As built (the activation lane, 2026-09-24): the early GET.* The drain's task
lets a frame render first; on the bench's mobile profile that frame held a
press's request 60–80 ms. A source's GET now leaves when the source records it:
`module-glue.js` starts it when the origin is one of the module's own
`net.fetch` grants and the request has no body, and the runner's `request` op
for the same method, URL and headers, with `cache: default` and redirects
refused (LLP 1016 D2), claims the response in flight instead of fetching. Admission and the
answer are unchanged: a GET the turn doesn't report is aborted as the turn
ends, and one the runner doesn't claim while the report is delivered is aborted
a task later. The glue also loads the body reader at data readiness. RealWorld
(nine runs, load 33): a press after a 3-second read, 313 → 252 ms (React 211);
at load, tap to feed 1,977 → 1,900 ms. The worker realm doesn't start early.

The 2026-08-29 note asked for this design first: "on the web the
browser is the executor, so one module runs under two loaders."

The web host macro takes the `exact_js_web::Module` type, plan, compatibility
receipt, factory, and optional paired artifact slices (README). Its data source
calls **one import**, `exact_js.call(op, ptr, len) -> len`: JSON input and a
second call copying JSON output into owned wasm memory, without re-entering the
borrowed host bridge. `exact-js-value` shares typed marshaling with native;
no JavaScript engine is linked into wasm. Compatibility receipts name `browser`,
not Hermes. `glue.js` waits for a rendering opportunity before loading
`module-glue.js`, its prelude and `app.js` (a served document, painted before
its glue runs, loads them beside the boot: LLP 1048.000 D6); `boot.mjs` still
counts one module.

Before loading, `DataSource::ready` is false and baked values paint the first
frame. The loader prepares a private realm, then `exact_data_ready` activates
logic and re-asks unbaked resources. A replacement verifies the receipt and
script, prepares a new realm, and boots the paired plan with compatible carry;
refusal disposes the candidate, success disposes the old realm. The JavaScript
is exactly the producer script `hermesc` compiled, never a second implementation.

**The web's globals.** One hidden iframe provides a private realm per module
incarnation. The shared prelude installs LLP 1027.000 guards before app code;
page and guest Date/Math/Intl are untouched. Direct XHR, sockets, event streams
and timers refuse; fetch goes through the prelude's host door and the runner's
HTTP request path. This is an authoring contract for trusted code, **not
a security sandbox**: it does not promise isolation against an app intentionally
reaching another window or browser capability. Native bake remains the same
module's narrower execution environment. Real Chrome regressions execute all
20 Caltrain data cases against the Rust oracle and all 25 ambient-read forms
at initialization, in answers and after fetch, with the shared native fixtures.
They also exercise explicit UTC/Intl times, reverse-order interleaving,
Promise-only settlement, store read/write/forget and grants, sequential and
parallel fetch, binary bodies, four transport failures, typed argument/source
errors, sync/async exceptions, stuck promises, corrupt/identity refusals and
disposal during a draining turn. Page and guest builtins remain untouched.

**iOS execution (Codex, 2026-09-07).** `js/build.rs` selects lean CMake archives
for the actual Rust target: `ios-simulator` for `*-ios-sim`/x86 iOS, `ios` for
devices. The host bake still uses the macOS VM/compiler; its shim explicitly
selects the macOS SDK even when the parent build targets iOS. All three engine
archives are copied into `OUT_DIR`, so normal bake receipts inventory the
actual linked engine inputs. Missing target archives produce a named refusing
stub, not an apparent working executor. Rust-only clients still link no VM.

Provisioning uses pristine Hermes at the commit `js/build.rs` pins
(`HERMES_PIN`, the one place it is written), matching the sibling ibex vanilla
headers and compiler. Do not substitute the full iOS framework (it embeds
a compiler). `host/apple/build.mjs --ios` runs this recipe itself when a
platform's archives are missing (LLP 1036.001 D5). For each platform it
configures the source with CMake:

```sh
cmake -S <matching-hermes-source> -B <build-dir> -G Ninja \
  -DHERMES_APPLE_TARGET_PLATFORM=iphonesimulator \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=17.0 \
  -DHERMES_ENABLE_DEBUGGER=OFF -DHERMES_ENABLE_INTL=ON \
  -DHERMES_ENABLE_TEST_SUITE=OFF -DHERMES_ENABLE_BITCODE=OFF \
  -DHERMES_BUILD_APPLE_FRAMEWORK=OFF -DHERMES_BUILD_SHARED_JSI=OFF \
  -DIMPORT_HOST_COMPILERS=<host-compiler-import.cmake> \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel
cmake --build <build-dir> --target hermesvmlean_a jsi boost_context -j 8
```

For device use `iphoneos`. The import file defines an `IMPORTED` executable
`imported-hermesc` with `IMPORTED_LOCATION` pointing to the matching macOS
compiler. These output paths are kept under each of
`~/.cache/exact/hermes/<pin>-lean-ios/{ios,ios-simulator}/`:
`lib/libhermesvmlean_a.a`, `jsi/libjsi.a`, and
`external/boost/boost_1_86_0/libs/context/libboost_context.a`.
`EXACT_HERMES_IOS_DIR` overrides that root. The build receipt names these
archives relative to the root. `EXACT_HERMES_DIR` continues to supply
`hermes-headers` and `macos-static`.

An external L=0 module client built with ordinary `host/apple/build.mjs --ios`
ran on iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5 simulator: async after `Promise.resolve()`, two
real HTTP requests, typed answer, then a local-import edit received at the same
URL as the browser. Both retained count 1 and displayed
`iOS live: 1: async fetched/200`, without rebuilding either binary. The browser
sample was 410 ms save-to-DOM / 430 ms to a rendering opportunity (348 ms
producer); it is not p50 and does not establish the 100 ms budget. The
`aarch64-apple-ios` release archive also builds.

**Expanded execution sweep (Codex, 2026-09-07).** An external guard app uses
the existing `js/tests/fixtures/inputs.ts` corpus, changing only its fetch
origin to the dev server and exposing its dispatcher to a typed test wrapper.
The iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5 simulator passes 25 initialization refusals,
25 direct refusals and 25 post-fetch refusals, plus explicit UTC/Intl values
and interleaved async inputs. It completes 27 real HTTP requests with no
pending work. A separate invalid HBC loaded by the test adapter at activation
(after first pixel) refuses an uncaught initialization-time `Date.now()` on
the iOS executor, not merely at macOS bake. The browser drives the same guard
app successfully through wasm and the host transport.

The larger browser drive exposed an unchanged-module reload bug:
`Runner::carry` treated an in-flight placeholder as a settled resource. It now
excludes pending resources, so the replacement re-asks them with their carried
arguments. The stale host incarnation still drops old replies. A regression
in `js/tests/inputs.rs` covers restart/re-request; the actual browser guard app
now completes after its initial dev-generation handoff.

A separate updater-free app assembles `js/tests/fixtures/caltrain.ts` with the
real Caltrain Contract, tests, assets, deck and GPU crate. The existing smoke's
complete app drive passes on web (12.2 s), iOS simulator (18.8 s), and macOS
(2.1 s on the clean rerun), including all three `app.test.contract` tests.
This drives station selection/search, timer/countdown updates, input events,
scheme changes, layout/image sizing, iframe load/message/input/pixels, GPU
loading and canvas children; screenshots were inspected. Production Caltrain
remains Rust. `--app-only` omits unrelated **host-only bare-plan fixtures**,
not the app drive or its tests: paired module clients correctly refuse those
unpaired plans. One earlier macOS run stalled in GPU drawable acquisition;
its rerun passed without changing the GPU implementation.

**Physical execution (Codex, 2026-09-07):** after unlocking, the signed guard
app installed on iPhone 17 Pro Max / iOS 26.6.1. Developer-console stdin was
EOF, causing a deliberate exit(0), not a VM crash. The replacement carrier
(1012) connects outward to a one-launch, token-checked Mac listener on a trusted
LAN. It drives the same guard app: 25 initialization, 25 direct and 25 post-fetch
refusals, explicit UTC/Intl and interleaved async inputs, 27 HTTP requests,
no pending work, and the separate uncaught initialization refusal. State/log
assertions pass and the copied screenshot was inspected. A second asserted run
passed in 5.7 s and reported 83.5 ms first frame (one sample, not p50).
One earlier state read stalled after settlement; cause remains unresolved,
and device requests now have a 45 s deadline. The first local-network connection
also refused before a relaunch connected. The newly included ibex host build
needed target-specific macOS `CXXFLAGS_aarch64_apple_darwin=-isysroot <macOS SDK>`
to avoid inheriting the iPhone SDK; this workaround does not fix that build script.
**Physical URL replacement (Codex, 2026-09-07):** the phone and browser opened
`http://192.168.1.4:8799/`. After pressing Run once and setting clock 12345,
changing only the TypeScript revision from `guards v1` to `phone live v2`
changed both displayed answers. Plan SHA-256 stayed
`191c9a79d4c39bad6e325bbb1c47f0284afcffecb40e06e36ba709e49d4e975b`;
HBC changed from `4198d6ee…` to `f64278d7…`. Phone PID 34089 and native binary
SHA-256 `8774da42bf63708064564934da798d7aee7bd5412d7f5f16e602291efc9b96be`
stayed unchanged throughout. Both retained attempt 1 and clock 12345 and reran
all 75 guards plus explicit inputs/27 HTTP requests with no pending work.
A candidate that bakes at attempt 0 but throws at carried attempt 1 was refused
by both, preserving their complete state. Restoring the answer as `phone live v3`
recovered both with the same PID, binary, state and successful sweep. Copied
phone screenshots show the changed results. Artifacts for this local run:
`/tmp/exact-phone-menu-proof.iYin4J/` (`proof.txt`, process snapshots, PNGs).

The apparent agent stalls included native crashes: the 09:42 and 13:30 device
reports both end in `UIGestureRecognizer._delayTouchesForEvent:inPhase:` trying
to insert nil. Disabling the developer menu isolated the problem and passed
the full proof once. Its recognizers now set `delaysTouchesEnded = false`;
the full proof above passes with the menu enabled and temporary tracing removed.
Two further default-menu launches pass `clock settle` after the guard sweep and
ten repeated state reads each, including the operation that previously timed out.
This is a verified mitigation, not a proof that every prior timeout had that cause;
manual four-finger menu recognition itself was not driven. Systematic linked
size/startup/per-call measurements remain owed; Linux still has a refusing stub.

**Physical Caltrain follow-up (Codex, 2026-09-07):** the TypeScript twin with
unchanged production Contract/tests, real assets, deck and GPU passes the full
app smoke and all three Contract tests on web (10.5 s), macOS (3.4 s), and the
physical iPhone (33.5 s; 98.0 ms boot, one sample). The phone screenshot initially
omitted the loaded web deck: main-queue request scheduling starved WebKit's
snapshot completion, and clean backing layers needed explicit capture redraw
(1012/1020). The corrected focused capture has 1334 guest-blue pixels versus zero;
the full smoke's screenshot assertion now passes.

Both clients then opened the same LAN URL, selected Palo Alto and advanced clock
60000. A TypeScript-only edit displayed `Palo Alto · live` on both; a candidate
that throws only for the carried Palo Alto station preserved their complete state;
the corrected `Palo Alto · recovered` edit recovered both. Slots, clock and both
train boards stayed unchanged, with no pending work. Plan SHA-256 stayed
`254d926fefec3ae6f4de491136d45a84c8c76d676c6f5075db06731ce096d055`;
HBC changed `c8e8668c…` → `30c2bb58…`. Phone PID 34336 and native binary SHA-256
`76204bf4d30299fb60cf11633a5c9ec2db29022e5dac94794a9a612e272ca064`
stayed unchanged. Phone screenshots were copied and visually inspected.
Local artifacts: `/tmp/exact-caltrain-phone-proof.RTsXNt/` (`proof.txt`, harness,
process snapshots, crash report and PNGs).

**Limit:** this Caltrain URL proof used `EXACT_DEV_MENU=0`. The preceding
menu-enabled attempt crashed at the first edit: the 14:03 report for PID 34325
again ends in UIKit `_delayTouchesForEvent:inPhase:` inserting nil. The earlier
non-delaying-recognizer mitigation is incomplete, not a default-client stability
claim. Manual menu gestures remain untested. One earlier full phone drive also
timed out on layout before capture; its cause remains unresolved.

**Crash follow-up (Codex, 2026-09-07):** filtering the developer menu to direct
touch events alone still crashed (14:13). The app's `UIHoverGestureRecognizer`
also inherited delayed touch endings. Hover now sets both delay flags and
`cancelsTouchesInView` false: observing the pointer cannot hold finger input
across node destruction. With that change and menu filtering, the complete
Caltrain/browser URL edit/refusal/recovery proof passes twice with the menu
enabled, finally with diagnostic tracing removed. Final phone PID 34489 and
binary SHA-256 `852b93502a58c46f1db0b0d7307518e16222f97291a67623aff642be50d856ba`
remain unchanged throughout, with station Palo Alto, clock 60000 and both train
boards carried. Artifacts: `/tmp/exact-onboarding.NsRIFE/final-menu-proof.txt`.
One earlier launch timeout and one type timeout remain distinct, unclassified
device failures; these are not claimed fixed. Manual four-finger recognition
still requires the human sweep. The tested menu-enabled binary also handles
cold/warm explicit development links without losing the agent connection (1030.000 §7).

**Real-touch correction (2026-09-07):** Charlie's Safari opening succeeds but
first touch/scroll still crashes with the same UIKit nil-insertion signature,
also in a console-observed normal launch with `EXACT_DEV_MENU=0`. The passing
agent proofs above do not establish touch stability (1012). Root cause remains
unconfirmed; temporary diagnostic hooks were removed without a new fix claim.
Normal URL replacement also reports a separate storage-configuration ordering
error outside agent mode. Both are in the queue; the next crash investigation
should reduce the UIKit reproduction rather than repeat the earlier mitigations.
**Follow-up:** the same-binary timing reduction now reproduces that exact crash
only in the tested pre-UIApplicationMain session-creation arm; the late-start
control survives Charlie's scrolling. Both iOS adapters now defer session
creation to didFinishLaunching (1012). Charlie subsequently accepted real touches
in the rebuilt regular Caltrain client ("seemed ok"). The separate storage-ordering
error was reproduced on a normal cold URL launch and fixed separately below.

**Storage-ordering fix (Codex, 2026-09-07):** Apple candidate preparation now
configures app-scoped directories before loading bytecode, then marks that
candidate activated so committed draws do not configure/load it a second time.
The focused ABI regression and all five repo checks pass; rebuilt simulator
Caltrain passed all three Contract tests and full UI smoke (7.3 s), and host-ios
passed the two-session smoke (3.5 s). The rebuilt physical client, launched
normally without EXACT_AGENT through the explicit URL at 17:50:40, reloaded with
no storage error. Warm delivery at 17:51:09 kept that console connection alive;
a subsequent TypeScript label edit published generation 26 and reloaded in the
same connected process (PID 35966). Binary SHA-256:
`5339bb5950e6a4613ace87117e1fddd12c740092520925ea72461aa3d16b1804`.
This is normal-launch activation evidence; retained-state edit/refusal/recovery
remains the earlier agent proof, and Safari confirmation UI/four-finger recognition
on this rebuilt client still require human checks.
Later in that drive, a server rebuild reported changed web inputs but unchanged
iOS inputs; the phone refused the changed program identity and retained its last
good generation. Warm delivery at 17:53 likewise retained PID 35966 but could not
join that newer generation without a relaunch. This is a separate queued rebuild
boundary investigation, not a storage activation failure or uninterrupted-live
reload claim. The temporary TypeScript label edit was restored.

Answering LLP 1026 §10 Q6 for this executor: the web loads the module
separately, *because it must* (there is no wasm form of it), and a
generation of `app.ts` is a restart with carry on the web too, not a new wasm
program. Deterministic host refusals wait for a new edit; transient fetch failures
retain the existing discovery retry behavior.

*A served page's answers, given to the module* (2026-10-01, the JS target,
`host/web-js/ts-data.js`). A module may export `kept(source, args, value)`.
Before the browser first asks it anything, the runtime gives it each answer
the page's document was rendered with (the checkpoint's, LLP 1048.000 D4),
converted as any argument is: they are the module's own answers, made by the
render host, which it may keep as it keeps any answer. Nothing else changes —
a resource still asks its source whenever its arguments move, and what the
source answers is its business. RealWorld keeps its
reads by source, arguments and reader until anything writes, as the other
RealWorlds' query caches keep a route's answers (Solid's router `query`, the
served page's included), so coming back to the home feed shows it at once: the
browse flow's "home" went from 239 to 19 ms on the benchmark's mobile profile
(Solid 21). Other hosts don't call `kept`; a module that keeps answers only
starts its cache with its own first reads there.

### D7 — Delivery: the module card carries bytecode; the runtime version carries the bytecode version

LLP 1026 D9–D12 apply verbatim with one substitution: the update
bundle's `module` card names `app.hbc` instead of a wasm module —

```json
"module": { "url": "./app.hbc", "sha256": "<hex>", "bytes": 11143, "abi": 1, "bytecode": "hermes-96" }
```

— and the runtime version (LLP 1026 D9: kernel schema, `formatVersion`,
ABI number, native-module roster digest) gains the engine's bytecode
version, because a bytecode file for one Hermes is refused by the
next (ibex2 bytecode.rs), and refusal must happen at the envelope,
before download, not at load.

**Digest identity (LLP 1026 D10) holds without change**: the binary
embeds `app.hbc`; a bundle whose module digest matches runs what is
embedded; a bundle whose digest differs runs the downloaded bytecode.
What differs from the wasm case is that *both* run in the interpreter
— there is no native form of a TypeScript module — so the "interpreted
window" of D10 is always open for TypeScript logic, at the cost §5
measures, and there is nothing to close at the next release.

**Level A and Level B (LLP 1026 D12) restated for the paved path:** a
TypeScript app's binary always links `exact-js` (it is the app's
logic), so a code update costs it no extra binary — Level B is free
where Level A was. A Rust-logic app is Level A with no interpreter, as
before. The one interpreter a phone binary carries is chosen by the
app's language (§8 records what this takes off LLP 1026's list).

Signing, anti-rollback, crash fallback, assets by digest, apply at next
launch, static files, no service: unchanged. The App Store clause is
the same one: interpreted code, downloaded, not changing the app's
primary purpose — the shape Expo Updates has shipped under for years.

### D8 — Rust and TypeScript side by side: one seam, routed by source name

An app may have `app.ts` and a `data/` crate. `exact_data::Mixed<J, R>`
composes them as one `DataSource` using explicit source-name lists. Its
constructor refuses duplicate ownership and disagreeing `appId`s before
calling either source; answering is never used to discover ownership.
The app's grants are the union; each source's Store access and requests
remain constrained to its own admitted grants. Update Lab and Fieldnotes
use this composer. A JS-only replacement explicitly retains Rust state;
enabled Rust replacement requires the complete paired receipt.
LLP 1027.001 records the implementation and language-parity principle.

This is how "optional" and "paved path" coexist without a mode: the
paved path is `app.ts` alone; the hot source moves to Rust one name at
a time, the fixture (D5) holding both to the same bytes; a Rust-only
app never links the engine (D3). There is no per-platform override
(`rules/DEFERRED.md` §Authoring models), because the seam is the
same on every host.

**Messages native consumer (Codex, 2026-09-12; Charlie's Snapback4 issue):**
The optional fifth argument to `answer`/source functions is the app's native
JSON module (`call(request)`), or `null` in the browser. The app links a
separate crate and supplies one factory through `Module::with_native`;
`exact-js` depends on no module implementation and owns no module registry.
The factory receives admitted grants and host-selected directories only on
post-pixel activation. Calls count as external reads, refuse at bake or without
configured storage, and never execute in disposable validation. Unload drops
the instance; replacement copies the factory and constructs a fresh one.
HTTP still leaves as ordinary `fetch` requests. Messages uses this door for
`exact-snapback4`, which reuses Ibex's grants/path authority and Snapback's
own device/interpreter. Both native SQLite users share the same rusqlite
version and linked SQLite library. The browser uses the matching published
Snapback4 0.2.30 Rust/Wasm device
over Exact's existing SQLite capability. Bake emits the separate asset; the
post-pixel data request loads it from the app's immutable asset namespace.
Only headerless, bodyless GETs of plain `/assets/…` paths use this local
read; external URLs still require the source and host network grants.

### D9 — ibex, in three: the standard library, the engine build, the runtime layer

Charlie's question — should ibex2 be split so the Rust standard
library and the Hermes/TS support can be included independently —
has the answer that the split already exists, plus one more cut.

1. **The standard library, no engine: `ibex2::host`** (ibex LLP 0068).
   `fetch`/`fs`/`env`/`secrets`/`kv` behind grants, `default-features
   = false`, no Hermes linked. exact2's Apple and Linux hosts link
   exactly this today for the request executor and the Keychain
   (host/apple/Cargo.toml:27, host/linux/Cargo.toml:30). This is "the
   stdlib available to Rust," and it is done.
2. **The engine build** — the vanilla Hermes lean VM and `hermesc`,
   per platform, with the receipt that binds bytecode to VM
   (`ios/Frameworks-vanilla/`: `macos-static/libhermesvmlean_a.a`,
   `hermes.xcframework`, `tools/hermes-vanilla/hermesc-macos-arm64`,
   `hermes-input-receipt.json`). Today it is a directory and a path in
   a `build.rs`. **Proposed: a crate** — `hermes-lean-sys` for this
   text — that carries the archives (or fetches them by digest at
   build), the headers, the link lines (build.rs:5–16 of ibex2's, less
   the Objective-C++), and `hermesc`'s path, and that both ibex2's
   engine layer and `exact-js` depend on. Owed for it: a Linux
   `x86_64`/`aarch64` lean build (the Hetzner builders, the Linux host)
   and an iOS device measurement (§10 Q7).
3. **ibex2's runtime layer** — `engine/hermes.rs`, `hermes_shim.cc`,
   the bindings (`fetch.js`, `timers.js`, `url.js`, `esm.js`,
   `harden.js`), the loader, the task queue, the pool — is what a
   JavaScript *program* needs. Refined 2026-09-03 by D1a and D10:
   `exact-js` links the engine adapter, the `fetch` binding and its
   pump, and the pure tier's bindings; it never links the module
   loader, the ESM lowering, `require`, or timers. A data source is
   still a function, not a program; the line is *modules and time*,
   not *bindings*. The probe is the demonstration: ~100
   lines of C++ against the vanilla headers, no ibex2 symbol in the
   binary.

So the "choose either" Charlie wants is: hosts choose (1) — already;
TypeScript apps choose (2) through `exact-js`; nobody in exact2
chooses (3). What could migrate from (3) to the paved path is ibex2's
*pure* tier — `url.js`, `headers.js`, base64, text — published as an
ordinary TypeScript package a module bundles in (D1's rule: no
reaching-out global), never linked (§10 Q6).

### D10 — What the module can and cannot use

**Storage integration (Charlie authorized; Codex, 2026-09-07):** answers receive
`(source, args, store, storage)`; generated source providers receive
`(args, store, storage)`. The declarations reuse Ibex2's canonical storage types.
The existing store is the secrets interface. `storage.fs` and `storage.sqlite`
use the shipped engine-independent Ibex2 Context and JSI adapter with Exact's
existing lean runtime, without a module loader or a second VM. The adapter and
SQLite factory are installed before app bytecode; Ibex2's baked hardening locks
its captured intrinsics. Storage objects are private capability arguments.

Native hosts select per-app data/cache/temporary directories after first pixel;
agent mode skips disk configuration. Apple uses Application Support and Caches;
Linux uses absolute XDG roots or the HOME defaults. Temporary is an app-cache
subdirectory, not an automatic cleanup promise. Grants come from the admitted
app identity (`fs.read`, `fs.write`, `sqlite.open`), not from module globals.
Resources close on unload, and directory configuration survives replacement.
Apple validates a painted replacement in a disposable source without real storage.
The accepted source stays deferred until commit and its paint receipt, when the
normal configure-then-activate sequence runs once. Before the first pixel,
preparation does neither. The ABI regression covers both painted states in
isolated normal/agent processes, including repeated draws.

Storage work runs in Ibex2's workers. A runner continuation carries readiness
through the host executor; only the runtime owner delivers a completion and
drains microtasks. It never invents an HTTP request. Bake refuses the capability.

**Browser provider (Charlie authorized; Codex, 2026-09-07):** the same capability
uses app-scoped IndexedDB files and pinned official SQLite WASM in a dedicated
worker. Each file operation is transactional; SQLite holds a Web Lock on its
file and shared ancestor locks until close, preventing another connection or a
filesystem mutation from losing committed data. Same-tab filesystem mutations
serialize; conflicts with other tabs or live databases return `Unavailable`.
Database bytes are ordinary SQLite files in the same namespace. Single-file reads
fetch only the requested IndexedDB record; directory listing reads its directory
record and descendant keys in the same transaction, without file contents. Read
buffers belong to the caller because IndexedDB clones each result. Writes and appends
fetch their target and parent; copies fetch source, destination and destination parent,
within the same write transaction. Directory creation reads its ancestors; removal
reads the parent and target/subtree keys without contents. Rename reads its source
subtree, source/destination records and parents, plus destination subtree keys to
reject a nonempty replacement. No operation enumerates unrelated file contents.
SQLite mutations still write a whole database snapshot. The worker transfers its
private, already-exported ArrayBuffer to the file store; that host-only operation
detaches the caller's buffer synchronously and avoids a second full-file copy.
The public filesystem still snapshots caller bytes before waiting for locks. Both
paths use the same atomic write transaction and failure behavior. A hidden Chrome
probe at 6802c38d compared eight alternating pairs of six writes to 0/4/12 MiB
payload databases, checking contents after close/reopen. With transfer, the median
of pair medians for 12 MiB fell from 29.4 to 26.3 ms; the median paired change was
−6.6%, with all eight pairs faster. The 4 MiB result was 12.1 to 9.3 ms in this
run, but an earlier copy-elision prototype was roughly flat at that size. These
are storage-operation timings, not a frame-rate or app-interaction claim.
A stat still reads the target record, including its contents, but no unrelated file.
Quota/persistence failures reject and invalidate a divergent SQLite connection.
Browser retention/eviction policy still applies; HTTPS/localhost supplies Web Locks.

Only the owning answer's checkpoint delivers a browser storage completion, with
its store context installed; no unsolicited microtask resumes app code. Database,
statement and filesystem handles close with the realm. Overlapping realms of one
app share the SQLite worker, with separate client handles and queues; the last
owner terminates it. This lets a reload reuse initialized SQLite while refusing
old handles and pending answers. Agent mode rejects storage.
The browser module loads filesystem and SQLite adapters on their first operation,
not when it creates a realm. The synchronous directory names and the host clock
are captured before Worker globals are hardened. Disposal while an adapter is
loading creates no backend; retired answers cannot start an operation after it
loads. Adapters remain shared with Rust's storage request path.
The build captures the runtime sources and pinned npm artifacts in its receipt,
and serves them lazily after first pixel. Browser/native fixtures cover grants,
SQL restrictions, integer/blob types, transactions, fetch interleaving, and
persistence across realm and page reloads. No filesystem work or app JS runs
before first pixel. `apps/fieldnotes` is the real consumer: a Contract editor with
TypeScript sources, SQLite notes, and a validated JSON backup in its app-scoped
filesystem. Native tests drive the baked artifact through save/search/pin,
restart, backup, deletion, and transactional restore. Snapback2 remains deferred.

- **Language:** Hermes's — ES2015 and most of what followed; no
  `eval`/`Function` (closed at construction); the current lean build does
  include `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (verified 2026-09-04; its default-time calls
  are guarded by LLP 1027.000); `fetch` per D1a; timers never. Whatever is missing is
  missing at the first call, by name, in the fixture the bake drives.
- **The pure tier, as Rust bindings (proposed 2026-09-03, recommended;
  Charlie: "would it make sense to just implement the wintercg spec in
  rust?" — that is ibex2's thesis, LLP 0057, and the pure tier exists:
  `stdlib::url`, `headers`, `base64`, `text`, WPT-tested).** The
  WinterCG minimum minus time and streams: `URL`, `URLSearchParams`,
  `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `atob`/`btoa`, `Headers`,
  `structuredClone`, `console`, `fetch` (D1a). Bound, not bundled, for
  three reasons: the grant checker and the module must parse a URL with
  *one* parser (ibex LLP 0059.000 §3.4: a partial URL parser is a
  security bug); the Rust is already linked in every native host
  through `ibex2::host`, so a binding is nearly free where a JavaScript
  polyfill is ~100 KB of source; and WPT conformance keeps native
  matched to the browser, which has these built in. Not: `setTimeout`,
  `performance.now` (the clock is the runner's), WebSocket and streams
  (a trigger), `crypto` (deliberately later). Marginal size over the
  lean engine: unmeasured; ibex2's binding bytecode is 28 KB.
  **2026-09-14 implementation:** LLP 1027.001 installs URL/URLSearchParams,
  TextEncoder, UTF-8 TextDecoder and atob/btoa through Ibex's algorithms.
  Browser realms retain browser implementations. This does not claim the
  entire proposed tier, other text encodings, or a new Headers implementation.
- **`console`**, admitted as the one host binding (Charlie, 2026-09-03;
  the alternatives — `fetch`, timers, a clock, secrets, files — are each
  refused by D1's rule, and the pure helpers are §10 Q6): `console.log` into the runner's `logs` (the agent API's,
  LLP 1012), 45 ns a crossing (ibex2's measured synchronous host
  call). It reaches nothing outside the process, so D1's rule holds;
  it is the affordance an agent editing `app.ts` in the cloud will
  reach for first.
- **npm packages:** admissible when they bundle to no reaching-out
  global — a date library yes, a GraphQL client no (it fetches; the
  module *describes* the request instead). The bundler resolves; the
  fixture judges.
- **Size and time:** the module runs under the executor's budgets — a
  wall-clock bound per call and a heap bound on the runtime (Hermes
  `RuntimeConfig` has both), the LLP 1026 D5 fuel-and-limits shape by
  the engine's own means; a call over budget is `Unavailable` and the
  last value stays on screen.
- **Not before first pixel, never in Contract, never touching the tree**
  — §7.

### D11 — `adopt`: a source may keep the value the runner already holds (2026-09-26)

A resource with a compiled value (D5; LLP 1038 D5) takes it at boot
instead of asking its source, so the runner decodes the bake's answer
and the source never sees it. A source that edits what it answers —
a feed a reaction bumps, a list a live tick prepends to — then had to
build that data a second time, from its own bundled input, to have
something to edit. The heavy-list benchmark held 10,000 messages twice
on the iPad this way: the runner's decoded value, and the port's own
parse of the same JSON into structs and a second set of rows.

```rust
fn adopt(&mut self, source: &str, args: &[Value], value: &Value) {}
```

- **When.** After the settlement that published it, once for each
  resource that took its compiled value in that settlement — at boot,
  and on a deferred executor's boot (D4), where the value stands in
  until `data_ready`. `args` are the ones the bake answered
  (`initial_args`), which are what `value` answers even where the
  resource's current arguments already differ. `value` is the runner's
  own object: a clone shares every list and record (`Rc<[Value]>`).
- **What it means.** "The runner shows this for `source(args)`, and
  this instance did not answer it." It is the bake's answer to the same
  query, from an empty store (LLP 1018 D4). A source may keep it as its
  own copy of what it would answer and edit it by building new values
  that share the unchanged parts; it may ignore it. The default ignores
  it, so every existing source compiles and behaves as before.
- **Forwarding.** A source that forwards `bind` forwards this: the
  mixed composer to the source that owns the name (D8), a swappable
  module to its embedded source. A source placed on a worker is not
  told (LLP 1027.002): a value reaches a worker only as a copy, and a
  copy is what adopting saves. The TypeScript executor ignores it; its
  values cross as JSON either way (D2).

What it does not change: the runner never asks a source whether it
adopted, never waits for it, and shows exactly what it would have shown
without it. The contract of `query`/`answer` is unchanged — a source
still answers every query itself, and one that adopted must answer as
it would have without adopting (the bake's answer is its own answer).
Nothing new is baked, carried, or sent to a host. A value that arrives
any other way — a carried value across a reload (LLP 1007 §6), a kept
store-reader answer, a document's seed (LLP 1048.000 D6), a placeholder
(LLP 1048.003 D6) — is not adopted: each may reflect a store, another
render, or an earlier instance's edits rather than this build's answer
from an empty store, and no consumer has asked for them.

## 5. Measured, 2026-09-03

The probe (§11, in the scratchpad, outside the repo — no apparatus
added): `caltrain.ts`, a port of `apps/caltrain/data/src/lib.rs` source
by source and message by message; `bun build` to one script,
`hermesc -O` to bytecode; a Rust binary that links the **lean** VM
through ~100 lines of C++, loads the bytecode, and drives twenty cases
through `exact.answer` against the native crate in the same process,
comparing `Value::to_bytes` (or `DataError`). This Mac, warm, release,
p50 where repeated.

| | |
|---|---|
| Source → script → bytecode | 9,808 B `.ts` → 6,037 B `.js` → **11,143 B `.hbc`**; 20 ms, three runs |
| `tsc --noEmit --strict --target es2020` | 0.43 s, no errors |
| `hermesc` alone (2026-09-03, Charlie's question): the 6 KB module, process start included | **7 ms** (10 runs, 70 ms) |
| `hermesc` on synthetic bundles, `-O0` / `-O` | 100 KB: 20 / 20 ms · 1 MB: 0.21 / 0.27 s · 5 MB: 1.0 / 1.7 s — about 3–5 MB/s of source; `-O` dead-code-eliminates, so those bytecode sizes are not comparable; the real module is 1.85× its script |
| Runtime create · bytecode load (n=20) | **0.322 ms · 0.008 ms** |
| Cases byte-identical (values) or equal (errors) | **20 / 20** — six sources, three argument sets of `board` (a full day, a terminus, mid-day), three of `search` (one hit, three, all), six error paths with the crate's exact messages |
| `login`: `answer` → request; `parse(200)` → a `Session` record; `parse(Refused)` → the crate's exact refusal text | as designed (D1) |

Per call through the seam, JSON both ways, decoded to `Value` (p50 of
2,000, the native crate on the same cases):

| Source | TypeScript µs | Rust µs | × |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaultLocation()` | 1.2 | 0.04 | 29 |
| `station("paloalto", loc)` | 2.1 | 0.08 | 25 |
| `search("Palo", loc)` | 3.0 | 0.29 | 10 |
| `nearest(loc, 3)` | 9.6 | 0.79 | 12 |
| `board("mv", "north", noon)` — 26 departures, from a 48-entry day | 40.9 | 5.46 | 7.5 |

The ratio falls as the work grows, because the fixed part is the two
JSON passes and the JSI string crossings (~1 µs), not the interpreter.
Caltrain's worst second is two `board` calls per tick: 82 µs. LLP
1026's wasm module measured 8–10× on the same crate; the two
interpreters are in the same band.

The engine's cost, linked:

| | |
|---|---|
| Probe binary, stripped (lean VM, JSI, the shim, the Rust) | 2,213,856 B |
| Same Rust, no engine referenced, stripped | 403,600 B |
| **The lean engine, dead-stripped, macOS arm64** | **+1,810,256 B** (+784,637 B gzip -9); `__TEXT` +1.70 MB |
| For scale: `libhermesvmlean_a.a` text, arm64 | 2.79 MB (the full `libhermesvm_a.a`: 4.78 MB) |
| For scale: the iOS device slice of `hermes.xcframework` (full VM, debugger variant) | 4.86 MB — not the shipping shape; the lean static link on device is owed (§10 Q7) |
| For scale: LLP 1026's wasmi executor | +1.0 MB |
| For scale: the whole Caltrain web app | 513 KiB wasm, 215 KiB gzip |

Unmeasured, and said so: the per-call number on a phone (Hermes on an
A-series core is slower than on this M5; the ratio to native should
hold, the absolute will not); the lean link on iOS; a module with a
real npm dependency; a store-writing `parse` (the probe's `parse`
reads only).

## 6. Costs and budgets

- **Binary:** +1.8 MB per native binary that links `exact-js` —
  TypeScript apps only; a Rust-only app pays nothing (D3). Against
  `rules/RULES.md`'s budgets it is not on any; against the phone it
  is the one number §10 asks about first, as LLP 1026 did for its 1.0.
- **Boot:** +0.33 ms, after first pixel (D4); the first-frame budget is
  untouched by construction. The one frame of `pending` for a
  store-reading resource is the observable cost.
- **Per call:** microseconds to tens of microseconds, per resource
  change, never per frame (§5). The 100 ms per-call budget is a runtime
  promise about a device. The bake's module (`js/bake`, after `Module::inspect`) is not held
  to it (2026-10-03): a heavily loaded build Mac failed the Signal Clone's
  bake at 104.8 ms and passed on retry. A build fails on the source, not on
  the machine's load. A runaway call hangs the bake as it did before; the
  budget is measured after a call returns, so it never ended one.
- **Edit loop:** +20 ms in the bake; the 100 ms edit-to-present budget
  holds with room.
- **Checks:** none added. The type check is bake's; the byte-equality
  fixture is one test in the runner's suite; `boot.mjs` counts what it
  counts.
- **The second language.** The real cost, and the ruling's. Two seams'
  worth of fixtures (one test, two implementations), two toolchains in
  the bake, two places an agent might put logic. D8 keeps it to one
  seam and one routing rule; the paved path keeps the default clear.

## 7. What this refuses, with the trigger to revisit

- **JavaScript in Contract expressions or `fn` bodies.** A second
  evaluator in the plan splits the derive graph, puts JS on the boot
  path, and makes the VM two VMs. Trigger: none; LLP 1017 P5's rule
  ("the first `fn` that wants a loop is evidence for the data crate")
  now points at `app.ts`.
- **JavaScript driving views, the tree, or native modules.** LLP 1026
  D7's boundary: a native module is platform code; the tree is the
  plan's. The module answers questions; it does not touch what is on
  screen. Trigger: none.
- **A JavaScript UI tier.** The React door stays open as
  `rules/DEFERRED.md` has it — designed against, not built. This
  document makes it neither closer nor farther: the seam is below the
  UI, and a React tier would be above it.
- **ibex2's runtime layer in the process** — the ESM loader, `fetch`,
  timers, the task queue (D9). A data source is a function. Trigger: a
  module that needs to be a program, which is a different thing and
  would be its own document.
- **JavaScript before first pixel**, on any host, by any amount (D4).
  Trigger: a ruling on the rule, not a design.
- **An asynchronous seam** (D1). Trigger: none foreseeable; LLP 1016
  is the asynchrony.
- **Source at runtime.** The lean VM cannot compile; nothing ships
  `.ts` or `.js` to a native host. Trigger: none.
- **Node or bun as the *runtime* executor for bake** — bake runs the
  module under the engine that will run it (D5). The faster-to-set-up
  alternative is §10 Q4.
- **JavaScript on the server** as the seam's other end — LLP 1023 §8
  and LLP 1026 §7 already refuse the proxied seam; the store is on the
  device.

## 8. The trades this RFC owes (Charlie's, before Acceptance)

The rule (`rules/DEFERRED.md` §Moving something off this list): name
what it unblocks, and take something off the doing-list in the same PR.

- **LLP 1004 D4 "the source is app code in Rust"** → "the source is
  the app's, in TypeScript by default or in Rust, behind one seam."
  Unblocks: substantial app logic in the language people and agents
  write it in, on every host, without a compiler in the loop — the
  ruling. **The take: LLP 1026 D2's wasm data module leaves 1026's
  staging.** With TypeScript as the paved path for logic, over-the-air
  *logic* travels as Hermes bytecode (D7); a Rust data crate is Level A
  — native, no interpreter, updated by binary — and the phone carries
  at most **one** interpreter, chosen by the app's language. wasmi
  returns only if LLP 1026 D6 (surfaces as wasm) is ever built, and
  then for surfaces. One executor slot, one engine per app, not two.
- **`rules/DEFERRED.md` §Runtime "HBC compilation"** → moved, for
  the *bake* only: `hermesc` runs at build, in the same step that
  compiles `app.contract`; nothing compiles at runtime, which is what
  the line was guarding (the parenthetical about reload is untouched;
  a module change is a restart with carry). Unblocks: D5. Take:
  covered above. **Ruled 2026-09-03: moved.**
- **`rules/DEFERRED.md` §Authoring models "One authoring model, one
  set of bugs"** → stays, with one added sentence proposed: *"Logic
  below the data seam is TypeScript by default or Rust; nothing runs
  JavaScript above it."* It is the honest statement of the second
  language's cost (§6), written where the cost is accounted. **Ruled
  2026-09-03: OK.**
- **`QUEUE.md` §Later, the ibex2 paragraph** → the engine's trigger
  ("a measured call site, after v1") is replaced by this ruling; the
  paragraph's "design that first" is D6, done. The `ibex2::host`
  half is unchanged and landed.
- **LLP 1026 §7 "A JS engine"** → withdrawn; D2–D3 of 1026 are the
  wasm executor, now for surfaces if ever; this document is the
  data-seam executor. 1026 §10 Q1 (is 1.0 MB acceptable) becomes §10
  Q3 here (is 1.8 MB), and Q6/Q7 are answered by D6/D5.
- **The 2026-08-29 ruling "zero app JS through v1"** → superseded by
  the 2026-09-03 ruling; recorded here so the two dates are one line
  apart.

### 8a. The first trade, at length (Charlie asked, 2026-09-03: "this is a big deal")

**What LLP 1004 D4 fixed, and what it only assumed.** D4 fixed the
*seam*: one place computation enters; arguments from state; a typed
request/response boundary; values refused unless they match the
declared shape; the first frame baked. That is the invariant every
later document leaned on — LLP 1016's settlement, LLP 1018's store,
LLP 1023's identity, LLP 1026's executor slot — and none of them
depend on the language behind the seam. D4 also *assumed* a language:
Rust, because the alternative's bill was an engine in every host plus
two features that did not exist yet. The features now exist; the
engine is 1.8 MB, once, after first pixel, optional. The sentence
changes because its premise did.

**What exact1's failure actually was.** Not JavaScript. It was
JavaScript *as the runtime*: 5.47 MB of ESM parsed at every boot, a
bridge that drove native views from JS, a module system and three
layers of defaults disagreeing under it. Every one of those is still
refused here — nothing before first pixel (D4), nothing touching the
tree (§7), no module system in the process (D9), one Rust runtime with
one set of defaults. What is admitted is JavaScript *as a library to
the Rust runtime*: a function the runner calls through a typed seam,
with no way to reach past it. That is the difference between the old
repo and this one, stated in one sentence, and it is why the ruling
does not reopen the old failure.

**Why the take is 1026's data module.** The rule wants a real
removal. LLP 1026 D2 existed to make *Rust* logic travel over the air
so the cloud loop could change logic without a rebuild. Under the
ruling the logic that changes often is TypeScript, and it travels as
bytecode through the same envelope (D7); Rust logic is what remains
Rust for a reason — hot sources, the runtime's own fixtures — and
changes at the cadence of a binary, which the cloud builds anyway
(1026 D8). Keeping D2 would mean a phone binary with two interpreters,
2.8 MB, for the case of a Rust source that wants an over-the-air
update and will not move to TypeScript. That case exists; its answer
is D8 (move the changing source) or a binary. So: one executor slot,
one engine per app, chosen by the app's language; wasmi is not planned
for data. It stays a possibility for *surfaces* (1026 D6, deferred with
its own trigger), and the one future case with two interpreters —
a TypeScript app with GPU surfaces travelling as wasm — is named here
so it is decided on purpose if it arrives.

**Alternatives for the take, and why not.** Taking the Rust data crate
itself (TypeScript-only) fails the ruling's "optional" and the compute
argument (§3). Taking nothing and calling the engine "replacement
apparatus" is not a removal. Taking LLP 1023's DNS-SD is already 1026's
take. Taking the React door is not a take; it is not on the doing list.

**What the change costs that the numbers do not show.** Two places an
agent may put logic — the seam and the paved-path default keep that to
one habit. The engine as an org dependency: exact2's TypeScript apps
build against a Hermes build the ibex repo produces, pinned by receipt,
vanilla only (D9); upstream cadence and Static Hermes are ibex's to
track. A hot TypeScript source on a phone at 10–30× — D8 and the
budgets. And the web asymmetry D6 names: the no-globals guarantee is
the engine's on native and discipline plus shadowing on the web, with
the bake and the native smoke as the sweep.

**What it buys, concretely.** Weird Castle's 607 lines of Rust become
an `app.ts` of about the size of exact1's `data.ts` (202 lines), with
JSON as JSON, strings as strings, no borrow checker, and an edit loop of
20 ms; its logic updates over the air as a signed bytecode file with
the binary unchanged; an agent in the cloud edits `app.contract` and
`app.ts` and never needs a compiler. Caltrain, all Rust, is untouched
and links no engine. The rules that made exact2 fast are the same
rules, and the check that counts the boot graph reads the same number.

## 9. Staging

Each stage ships alone. **Implementer: Claude (Fable 5.1); stage 1
begun 2026-09-03**, the day of acceptance. The order below is revised
from r1 for D1a: `fetch` and the pure tier are stage 3, before the web
and before Weird Castle, because both need them. Two foundations
surfaced in the first hour of building and are stage 1's: **the plan
carries the seam's signatures** (a `sources` table — name, parameter
types, result type — unified across every `resource` and `send` that
names the source, so the executor names record fields from the plan
and `app.d.ts` is generated from the plan, one authority), and **the
module's `appId` and `grants` are bake outputs** beside the bytecode,
so boot reads them without an engine (the identity gate and the store's
grants are read at boot, runner.rs:440 and :466).

1. **`exact-js`** (D2, D3, D10): the crate, the shim, the
   shape-directed marshaling from `plan.fields`, the budgets, `console`
   if admitted. Caltrain's TypeScript twin (§11) kept as `exact-js`'s own
   test fixture — never an app file: Caltrain stays all Rust and other
   apps carry the TypeScript experiments (Charlie, 2026-09-03) — the
   byte-equality test as the runner's. The Apple and Linux hosts link it after the paint gate;
   `metrics.mjs` gains the engine's create-and-load row. Verified by
   driving it: `smoke.mjs macos` and `linux` green on the twin; a
   module that calls `fetch` refused by name; a looping module refused
   by budget with the last value on screen; a `Promise` refused.
2. **Bake and the dev loop** (D5): bundle, compile, evaluate through
   the engine, `app.d.ts`, the `tsc` step; `dev.mjs` watching `.ts`;
   the pending-one-frame rule (D4). Verified: edit `board` in `app.ts`,
   the macOS window shows it in under 100 ms; a wrong-shaped answer
   refused at bake by `tsc` and, with the check bypassed, at the seam.
3. ~~**`fetch` and the store**~~ — **landed 2026-09-03** with stage 1's
   commit's successor: D1a as built (above), `parse → Answer`, the store
   as host-door ops, `js/tests/castle.rs` (login, a failed fetch, a
   two-fetch chain, refusals before and after a fetch, an answer pending
   on nothing, and the same through a compiled Contract and the runner).
   Owed from it: the pure tier from ibex2. The clock shadow was superseded
   and the ambient-input gap fixed by LLP 1027.000 on 2026-09-04.
4. **The web** (D6): the data module after first paint, the
   not-yet ticket, restart with carry. Verified: `smoke.mjs web` green
   on the twin; `boot.mjs` unchanged at one module; parity of every
   answer with the native hosts through the agent's `state`.
   The baked browser module now reads its receipt and script from the
   wasm's existing `exact_module_artifact` export instead of fetching those
   same bytes again. Each read copies the bridge buffer before the next
   export; receipt, identity, grants and script-hash admission still run.
   A development replacement still supplies its paired payload explicitly.
4. **Weird Castle in TypeScript** — the paved path's first real app:
   `loginV2`, `remember`, `accounts`, `switch`, `logout`, `stillLife`,
   the token book in the store (LLP 1018 D5), as `app.ts`; the Rust
   crate kept until the twin answers the same bytes, then deleted
   ("delete; don't deprecate"). This is the call site the 2026-08-29
   ruling asked to be measured; it is measured here as the fixture.
5. **Delivery** (D7): the `module` card with `bytecode`, the runtime
   version's new component, a signed TypeScript update to an installed
   Caltrain twin at the next launch. Verified as LLP 1026 Stage 2/3
   verify, with the bytecode-version mismatch refused at the envelope.
6. **The engine crate** (D9): `hermes-lean-sys` in the ibex repo; Linux
   lean builds; the iOS device link and its numbers into §5.

Deferred, each with its trigger in the text: the JSI walk instead of
JSON (D2 — when a per-call number asks); the pure-tier package (D9 —
when a module wants `URL`); the Rust seam's own bytes ABI for
over-the-air Rust (LLP 1026 D2/D3 — if surfaces-as-wasm is built).

## 10. Open questions (for Charlie)

1. **The bake's TypeScript toolchain:** `bun build` (bundles, strips,
   fast; one more tool on the build machine and the fleet) or ibex2's
   Oxc strip alone (already a Rust dependency; single file, no
   imports, no npm)? Leaning was bun, because "substantial logic" will
   import files. **Charlie leans Oxc (2026-09-03)**, and the shape that
   follows is: one file and no imports first; when a module imports a
   relative file, ibex2's ESM lowering plus `oxc_resolver` concatenated
   into one script with a ten-line `require` shim (small Rust, no second
   runtime on the builders); npm packages are the trigger for more, and
   Rolldown keeps that in Rust. **Ruled 2026-09-03: Rolldown** — the
   Oxc-family bundler, Rust, one step for strip, bundle, and npm
   resolution, emitting one IIFE script lowered to the syntax `hermesc`
   accepts (what it lacks fails at bake, which is the check). Owed:
   whether the Rust crates are consumable from a `build.rs` or the npm
   CLI (node is already required) is the integration.
2. **`console` as the one binding** into `logs` (D10)? Leaning: yes;
   it is 45 ns and reaches nothing. **Ruled 2026-09-03: yes.**
3. **Is +1.8 MB acceptable in release iOS** for a TypeScript app? It
   replaces LLP 1026's 1.0 MB question for the paved path. And the
   one frame of `pending` (D4): acceptable, or is a sub-millisecond
   bytecode load before boot a ruling you want to make on the rule?
   Leaning: accept both; the frame is the rule's honest price.
   **Ruled 2026-09-03: the size is acceptable given the engine is
   optional per app (D3).** The frame stands as designed.
4. **Bake's executor:** the lean VM (D5, one engine everywhere, needs
   the engine crate on every build machine) or `bun` (already there,
   faster to stand up, a second engine whose answers the fixture must
   hold equal)? Leaning: the VM; the fixture would catch a divergence
   but "provably the module's" is worth the setup. **Charlie,
   2026-09-03: "the lean VM seems right."**
5. **Does Caltrain keep its Rust crate** once the twin exists, as the
   Rust seam's fixture (D8's both-sides case), or does it become
   TypeScript-only and Weird Castle carries the Rust fixture? Leaning
   was both. **Ruled 2026-09-03: Caltrain stays all Rust; other apps
   experiment with TypeScript.** The twin is a test fixture only (§9).
6. **The pure tier as a package** (D9): should ibex2's `url.js`,
   `headers.js`, base64, and text helpers become a TypeScript package
   a module can bundle, or does a module bring its own from npm?
   Leaning: leave it to npm until a module asks.
7. **The iOS numbers:** the lean static link on a device and the
   per-call tax on a phone are owed before Acceptance, or is the macOS
   number enough to rule on? Leaning: owed; it is an afternoon with
   `build.mjs --device`. **Charlie, 2026-09-03: not a blocker;**
   measured when a device build happens.
8. **`fetch` as the normal thing** (D1a)? Leaning: yes; the training-data
   argument is Charlie's and it costs one binding and a pump the host
   machinery already implies.
9. **The pure tier as ibex2's Rust bindings rather than bundled JavaScript**
   (D10)? Leaning: yes, for the one-parser reason first.
10. **Naming:** `exact-js`, `hermes-lean-sys`, `Either` — or the names
   the implementer picks.

## Ratification note

Draft r1, 2026-09-03, written the day of the ruling and after the
probe in §5 ran; **accepted the same day** by Charlie with every
recommendation, after the questions of §10 were each argued in
conversation and their answers written inline. Unreviewed by a panel.
The numbers are this Mac's; the iOS numbers are owed and not blocking.
An implementer and a date are named (§9); the trades of §8 land with
stage 1, as the rule says.

## 11. Appendix — the probe, verbatim

In the scratchpad, outside the repo, built against `~/projects/ibex/ios/Frameworks-vanilla/` (the lean VM) and `tools/hermes-vanilla/hermesc-macos-arm64`. `build.sh` makes the bytecode; `cargo build --release` in `hostprobe/` makes the two binaries; `./target/release/hostprobe ../caltrain.hbc` prints §5.
