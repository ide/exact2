# LLP 1071: exact2's web target — a small JS runtime, Contract compiled to JavaScript, the DOM as the tree

**Type:** RFC
**Status:** Draft, with rulings (§8): Charlie approved the spike on 2026-09-28, then ruled the same day that this is exact2's web support, a new compile target for the same Contract — not a new framework, not "Exact 3" — used by default where an app qualifies, the wasm target the fallback until §7's gaps close.
**Systems:**
- Contract: a second backend, from the validated plan to JavaScript (`host/web-js`, crate `exact-web-js`).
- Web host: a JavaScript runtime beside `exact-web` (`host/web-js/rt.js`); the glue, capture and adoption.
- Build: `host/web/build.mjs` builds the JS target, and what it refuses fails the build (a game builds wasm, §8; `--wasm` is internal); a build-time stylesheet from `css.rs`. The dev loop, the agent's web host, the smoke and metrics run what it makes (§7, "The tools").
- Render server (LLP 1048): unchanged as the producer of documents; the checkpoint gains instance state for D6.
- Agent (LLP 1012): the nine operations over the JavaScript runtime, in a development module.
- Native hosts: none.
**Author:** Claude (Opus 5.5) for Charlie Cheever
**Implementer:** Claude (Opus 5.5), from 2026-09-28: the spike (§7, branch `exact3-web-spike`), then on main as `host/web-js`.
**Date:** 2026-09-28
**Related:**
- LLP 1047 (pay for what you use): §1 and §10's measurements, D9's budget, §8's "compile the plan instead of interpreting it" (`1047:440-445`), the DOM-only kernel (`1047:1063-1071`).
- LLP 1047.000 (staged loading): runtime-up timings (`1047.000:36-55`), levers sized and declined (`1047.000:99-111`).
- LLP 1048, 1048.000, 1048.001: documents, the checkpoint, adoption, activation and the capture script.

## Summary

Charlie, 2026-09-28: *"I'm interested in making the best possible version of
Exact for the web. The biggest problem is a fairly big runtime wasm, ~300 KB,
that has to be downloaded before you can really do anything. I'd love to see
that get down to like 20 KB. If we reimagine this from the beginning, even an
Exact 3, could we get that down to ~20 KB? What sacrifices?"*

The answer is yes on the web, and not by trimming.

- **Trimming exact2 stops at about 150 KB brotli** (§2, an estimate). What is
  left is a Rust interpreter, a tree mirror, a batch protocol and Rust's std.
  In a browser, each duplicates something the browser already has.
- **About 20 KB needs a different web runtime** (§3):
  1. Contract compiled ahead of time to JavaScript: the code is the plan.
  2. The DOM is the tree; fine-grained signals write to nodes.
  3. Static styles go to a build-time stylesheet; only dynamic values are inline.
  4. A JavaScript runtime of about 5–8 KB.
  5. Everything else loads on first use.
  6. Optionally, resumability: HTML plus a ~2 KB loader.
- **The estimate:** about 6–10 KB of runtime plus generated code at 1–2× the
  plan's brotli size. That is ~10–15 KB for a small app and ~20–25 KB for
  Caltrain, against 242 KB and 302 KB of wasm today.
- **What it costs** (§5): one engine on every host becomes two runners held
  equal by a conformance suite (§4). Plans stop being validated data on the
  web. Rust sources on the web load as their own wasm. Formatting needs specs.
  Inspection leaves the shipped bundle.
- **What stays** (§6): Contract, the plan, the native hosts, the renderer, the
  data seam, one source.

It is the rule "the web is the standard" taken one step further: on the web,
stop emulating the browser and be it. It is a compile target, not a framework:
the same Contract, the same plan and the same data seam, lowered for the web
as the Apple and Linux hosts lower them for theirs.

## 1. Measured

2026-09-28, at `2cf49c21`, on an Apple-silicon Mac.
- **Build:** `host/web/build.mjs` on the web toolchain (`WEB_TOOLCHAIN`, LLP
  1047 §10). These builds are unsplit: binaryen 133 is installed against the
  pinned 132, so the ~8–11 KB inspection stage is inside `app.wasm`.
- **Compression:** brotli quality 11.
- **Attribution:** a names build, each function to the first exact2 module its
  demangled name mentions (LLP 1047 §1's rule). Each group is brotli'd alone,
  so the groups sum to ~260 KB against the whole's 242: shares, not a ledger.
- **Comparable runtimes** are from knowledge, not measured here, except
  React's counter (`1047:66`).

### Sizes

| Artifact, brotli-11 | Bytes |
|---|---|
| Video player `app.wasm` (35 lines of Contract) | 242,316 |
| Caltrain `app.wasm` | 302,148 |
| `glue.js` | 16,949 |
| `navigation.js` | 6,954 |
| document, input and timer glue | ~4,900 |

The video player's wasm went 368 KiB (`1047:64-67`) → 365,025 B
(`1047:103-120`) → 242,316 B. Linking by use, the core diet and the web
toolchain took a third; the rest is the core.

### What loads when (Caltrain)

- **First paint** is the served HTML, 5.7 KB, with no wasm (LLP 1048.000).
- **First interaction** needs ~330 KB: the wasm, the glue and the data module.
- **Activation** runs when the page is idle after `load`, or at the first
  input, whichever comes first; a press before it replays once
  (`1048.000:247-250`, `1048.000:408-414`).
- **Runtime up** is ~1,890 ms on the bench's mobile profile, against ~950 ms
  for React SSR to hydrate (`1047.000:36-55`).

### Where the video player's bytes go

| Group | KB brotli |
|---|---|
| Runner (boot, actions, events, commit) | 35.7 |
| Kernel tree, transactions, ids, arena | 30.0 |
| Kernel styles (generated `StyleProps`, style, SVG) | 26.2 |
| Web host (batch, CSS, ABI) | 24.6 |
| Plan decoder and validator 12.1, values 12.8 | 24.9 |
| Rust std, hashbrown, glue | 24.4 |
| Instances and reactivity | 13.9 |
| VM and stdlib | 10.1 |
| Served-page adoption | 9.1 |
| Motion | 9.1 |
| Inspection | 9.1 |
| Data seam | 6.8 |
| `exact_num` 5.2, libm 4.1, dlmalloc 2.3, `core::fmt` 2.3 | 13.9 |
| Data segments | 21.8 |

Taffy's layout code is not linked on the web. The largest functions
(`twiggy top`, raw): `vm::eval` 16.5 KB, `StyleProps::set_dynamic` 14.7,
`txn::apply_document` 13.2, `Plan::decode_from` 9.6, `Plan::validate` 7.8.

### What the web host does today

- **The browser lays out.** Real CSS is emitted from style rows
  (`host/web/src/lib.rs:7-13`, `host/web/src/css.rs:1-13`). The kernel never
  lays out on the web: `Kernel::on_demand` starts with `layout: None`
  (`kernel/src/kernel.rs:250-263`).
- **The browser measures text** (`host/web/src/host.rs:281-295`).
- **The DOM is built from JSON batches** (`host/web/src/batch.rs:1-5`), parsed
  and applied by the glue (`host/web/glue.js:1323`, `606-621`).
- **So the wasm keeps a second tree.** It holds a full kernel mirror of the
  DOM, and style rows it parses and then prints back out as CSS text.

### Levers already sized and declined

| Lever | Yield, KB brotli | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A DOM-only web kernel | 10–15 | `1047:1063-1071` |
| Errors as codes | 5–8 | `1047.000:101` |
| A non-generic runner | 0 | `1047.000:106` |
| Non-generic maps | 2–3 | `1047.000:110` |

Parity with React on RealWorld's feed timing needed 129–133 KB, which nothing
sized reached (`1047:1019-1020`). RULES has no byte budget: D9's "core web
payload" row (`1047:333-343`) became a reported outcome, never blocking
(`1047:478-488`).

### Comparable runtimes (knowledge, min+brotli, approximate)

| Runtime | KB |
|---|---|
| Qwik loader | ~1 |
| Svelte 5 | ~3–10, plus compiled code |
| Preact | ~4–5 |
| Solid | ~7 |
| htmx | ~15 |
| React + ReactDOM | ~45–55 (a Vite counter measured 58 KiB, `1047:66`) |
| wasm3-class interpreters | 60–100 |

## 2. Why trimming stops at about 150 KB

Every sized lever, applied to the video player (estimates, from 242 KB):

| Lever | KB |
|---|---|
| Inspection out of the shipped bundle (the stage, once binaryen matches) | −9 |
| Motion linked by use (the player has no transition) | −9 |
| Adoption only on served pages (the player isn't served) | −9 |
| A DOM-only kernel | −10 to −15 |
| CSS as text at build, instead of `StyleProps` at runtime | −10 to −15 |
| Errors as codes | −5 to −8 |
| Staging what the first interaction doesn't run | −10 to −20 |
| Data segments those take with them | ~−5 |
| **Left** | **~150–170** |

Add ~24 KB of glue and the first interaction still costs ~175 KB. Caltrain
stays ~60 KB above that, for its plan, adoption and capabilities.

What remains is five things a browser already has:

| What the wasm carries | KB | What the browser already has |
|---|---|---|
| An interpreter: VM, plan decoder and validator, values | ~35 | a JavaScript engine that runs code |
| A tree and its transactions | ~20–30 | the DOM |
| A style model printed as CSS | ~10–26 | the CSS parser |
| A boundary: batches, ABI, JSON, and the glue across it | ~25 + 17 JS | direct DOM calls |
| A language runtime: std, hashbrown, dlmalloc, libm, `fmt`, `exact_num` | ~38 | `Map`, the GC, `Math`, `String(n)` |

Wasm can't touch the DOM, so the boundary is structural: every mutation is
encoded in Rust and decoded in JavaScript. A plan is data, so it needs an
interpreter. The floor is the Rust/wasm runtime itself. LLP 1047 §8 named
the way past it and set it aside: compile the plan instead of interpreting
it (`1047:440-445`).

That note priced compiling at three things. Here, on the web only:
- **The 20 ms plan restart.** Emitting JavaScript from a plan is a
  build-time pass of milliseconds. The spike measures it (§7).
- **Plans delivered without a new binary.** A web release is static files
  either way (§5.2).
- **One runner shared by every host.** This is the real cost (§5.1).

## 3. The design

The web gets its own runner, written in JavaScript and fed by a compiler
backend. The plan stays the interface: the backend reads the plan the Rust
runner reads, after `Plan::validate`, so both runners start from one artifact.

### D1 — The plan compiled ahead of time to JavaScript

- **Input:** the validated plan, not Contract's AST. The plan is already the
  interface between compiler and runners, and it is what the conformance
  fixtures (§4) are.
- **Output:** ES modules, one per route chunk, and a manifest.
  - **A component** becomes a function. Its static structure is a
    `<template>`, cloned. Its bindings are effects on the cloned nodes.
  - **State slots** become signals, `derive`s become computeds, actions become
    functions that write signals.
  - **Expressions** become JavaScript expressions. Roster calls become imports
    from the runtime's roster, so the bundler drops unused entries.
  - **Binding sites keep their plan node index** as a `data-s` attribute where
    a node is dynamic, so the Rust renderer's document and the generated code
    name nodes alike (D6).
- **Gone:** the decoder, the validator and the VM. Validation runs once, at
  build.
- **Tree shaking returns to the bundler.** LLP 1047 had to make the compiler
  the tree shaker because a plan is data (`1047:39-44`). Generated code
  imports what it uses; Rolldown drops the rest.

### D2 — The DOM is the tree

- **No mirror.** There is no kernel, no `ViewId` map and no batch. An effect
  writes one property, attribute or text node.
- **Commits.** An action's writes land together: effects run after the action
  returns, flushed once per event turn, as the Rust runner commits once per
  event.
- **`when`** is a region between two comment anchors; its subtree and its
  effects are disposed when it closes.
- **Keyed instances** (`for … key`) reconcile by key over DOM nodes: moves by
  longest increasing subsequence, instance scopes disposed on removal. Keyed
  row state lives in keyed data, as LLP 1068 §5.3 already requires.
- **Regions** (`runner/src/instance/region.rs`) use the same anchors.
- **Events** are delegated: one listener per event type on the root,
  dispatched by a `data-on` attribute to the handler the component registered.
  The capture script's `data-exact-on` (`host/web/capture.js`) is the same
  mechanism before activation.

### D3 — Styles to a build-time stylesheet

- **Static rows** become classes in one stylesheet emitted at build. The CSS
  comes from `css.rs`, run at build instead of in the browser, so the
  row-to-CSS projection stays one Rust implementation.
- **Dynamic rows** become `style.setProperty(name, value)`. The backend emits
  each bound row's unit and name rule inline, so only rows the app binds cost
  bytes.
- **Motion** is already CSS on the web (LLP 1002 D6). A static `spring()`
  becomes keyframes at build; a dynamic one loads the spring module (D5).

### D4 — A runtime of about 5–8 KB

| Piece | ~KB brotli |
|---|---|
| Signals, computeds, effects, disposal | 1.0 |
| Keyed reconciliation, regions | 1.0 |
| Event delegation | 0.5 |
| Data-seam client: resources, requests as values, grants, `conforms` | 2.0 |
| Router: locations, History, link interception | 1.0–1.5 |
| Timers under a seekable clock | 0.5 |
| Roster core | 0.5–1.0 |

**Resources and the data seam.** A `resource` compiles to a keyed cell of
pending, answer or failure, keyed by source and arguments. The seam keeps
LLP 1027's contract: `answer`, `parse`, requests as values the host runs
under grants, the store. The TypeScript module still runs in its private
realm (`1027:688-760`). The `exact_js.call` import and its JSON copies into
wasm memory go away: the runtime calls the module directly. Shapes are
checked at the seam, as `Value::conforms` does today.

**The router** is LLP 1038's table compiled to patterns and lazy chunks.
Navigation data follows LLP 1048.001 D7. Much of `navigation.js` becomes this
module.

### D5 — Everything else on first use

Generated code `import()`s a capability where it is first used. This is LLP
1047 D1's third tier, with the bundler finding the use-set:
- springs and dynamic motion; exit and layout transitions;
- text flow (already its own wasm); Markdown reading; the editor (already
  separate);
- SVG and Canvas 2D beyond the elements themselves; the GPU module and
  storage (already separate);
- virtualized collections, drag and reorder;
- `formatDate` and `formatNumber` (`runner/src/format.rs`, already linked by
  use);
- inspection and the agent's nine operations: development builds only (§5.5).

A plan that uses a capability the JavaScript runtime lacks is refused at
build, by name, as LLP 1047 D6 refuses an unlinked one. That lets the runtime
grow one capability at a time.

As landed, the backend and `host/web-js/build.mjs` refuse by name: a
dynamic `virtualized`, a dynamic canvas bitmap size, the events and the
dynamic rows in §7's table. `host/web/build.mjs` printed the refusal and
built the wasm target; since 2026-09-29 the refusal fails the build. RealWorld, the video player, completion-storm,
Motion Gallery, Typetour, Carousel, LLP, Markdown, auth-fixture, Sparkline,
SVG Gallery, Spark, Messages, Messages Stress, Markdown Stress, Reflow and
Text Flow build JS,
and so does Bluesky, outside the repo
(`EXACT_APP_DIR`, §7 below); since 2026-09-29 (§7, "Build and toolchain
gaps") so do Caltrain and Weatherlight (the build makes their GPU modules),
Canvas Gallery (TypeScript draws), Update Lab (a TypeScript and a Rust
source) and the native-module apps (native-fixture, photo-editor, map-demo,
recorder), and, with files and storage (§7, "Files and storage"),
Fieldnotes and Markdown; with Arrange, exact-live and interaction-gallery
("Arrange, the reorder drag"). Every app in `apps/` builds JS.

### D6 — Documents, activation and resumability

**LLP 1048 is unchanged as the producer.** The Rust renderer, running the Rust
runner, still makes every document, at build or per request. First pixels
stay HTML, so "App JS executed before first pixel: none" holds.

**Activation, first form (the spike's).** An undeclared route is `eager`:
the served head carries `<link rel=modulepreload>` for the entry and any
chunk it imports statically, so the ~20 KB runtime downloads while the
document streams; the capture script imports it at the page's first paint
entry, once the document is parsed, so no module script runs before first
pixel. `activate=idle` keeps 1048.000's policy (idle after `load` and first
paint, `1048.000:247-250`); `activate=interaction` fetches nothing before the
first press or edit. On every policy a press before activation starts the
import and replays once. The runtime runs the route's components against the
checkpoint, claiming existing nodes by `data-s` instead of creating them. A
mismatch renders fresh once, as today. The difference is ~20 KB to fetch
instead of ~330.

**Early flush.** The render server sends a page's head as a browser's
navigation (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`) arrives, before any data is asked:
doctype, charset, the capture script, the entry's `modulepreload`s and the
stylesheet, after a 103 Early Hints naming the same preloads. The title,
metas, document and checkpoint follow when the render settles, as one
chunked, brotli-flushed response (`host/render/src/stream.rs`). The status
goes with the head, so a flushed page is a `200`, `private, no-cache`, with
no ETag. A render that then turns 404, 410 or 503 sends that document; one
that fails sends the 500's text after the head; only a flushed 200 is kept
at the origin. Crawlers, `curl`, CDNs, conditional requests and `HEAD` send
no `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, so they still wait and get the real status and
validators. A flushed page needs `lang`/`dir` that the plan alone decides. The
JS render path (`render.mjs --serve`) streams the same way. Chrome acts on a
103 only over HTTP/2, so on the bench's HTTP/1.1 loopback the 103 changes
nothing; it is there for a CDN in front.

**A smaller page.** The checkpoint's answers are JSON text (lossless:
records `{"r":[…]}`, `some` `{"s":…}`, `none` `{}`; `-0` and non-finite
numbers kept), not base64 value bytes, so brotli matches them against the
document's own strings. The Rust document over the JS shell carries the
stylesheet's class where an inline style equals one, and drops the wasm
runtime's view ids (a link keeps an empty `data-view`, as the runtime's
links have). RealWorld `/`: 9,652 → 6,388 B brotli as sent, pixel-identical
with and without JavaScript. Adoption is unchanged: RealWorld 21/21 served
(`--urls`) and client-rendered, Weatherlight 12/12, the synthetic plans
green.

**On the RealWorld bench** (mobile profile, 25 runs interleaved, medians
with p25/p75, same-session React and Octane SSR controls;
realworld-bench `bench/results/flush20.md`, `flush170.md`; exact3-web-spike
`1877567a`, `59099fbf`), rendering every request as the SSR servers do:

| API per answer | FCP (JS / React SSR / Octane SSR) | runtime up, no input | page-2 press → answered | code KB before interactive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 ms | 388 (316–396) / 344 (312–392) / 372 (328–404) | 659 / 950 / 1,091 | 453 / 407 / 390 | 26.1 / 81.0 / 103.8 |
| 170 ms | 372 (328–404) / 360 (312–384) / 372 (308–400) | 645 / 948 / 1,038 | 307 / 324 / 283 | 26.1 / 81.0 / 103.8 |

FCP stays within noise for all three at both API speeds. The emulated 150 ms
RTT and 1.6 Mbps link set it, and the flush keeps a 170 ms backend out of it.
The runtime is up about 300 ms before React SSR hydrates, on a third of
React's code. The page-2 press is within noise.

**Every served page becomes a conformance fixture.** Adoption succeeds only if
the JavaScript runner's canonical document equals the Rust renderer's.

**Resumability, the second form (optional).** The document carries its
checkpoint plus each instance's slot values, and a ~2 KB loader: the capture
script, delegation and a chunk map. The first event on a `data-on` element
imports that component's chunk and the runtime, restores its signals from the
checkpoint, and binds effects to the existing nodes. Nothing re-renders.
- **It needs:** the checkpoint (`1048.000` D6) gains instance state. Today it
  deliberately carries answers, never a store (LLP 1048 D4).
- **It gives:** LLP 1048.001's `interaction` policy nearly for free, and a
  page that never needs its runtime loads none (already D5 `never`).

### How it meets LLP 1047's capabilities

| 1047 capability (`1047:348-366`) | Here |
|---|---|
| Motion | CSS as today; springs lazy |
| Markdown markup, editor | lazy; the editor is already a separate wasm |
| Text flow | lazy, the existing wasm |
| Router | a runtime piece, ~1–1.5 KB |
| Virtualized collections, drag | lazy |
| Rust data modules | their own wasm, lazy (§5.3) |
| Fonts, media | the elements' own attributes; media glue lazy |
| Inspection | development builds only |
| GPU canvas, storage | unchanged, already loaded on demand |

## 4. Parity and conformance

Today the web and native agree by construction: one runner. Here they agree
by test.

**The fixtures:**
- `contract/corpus/*.contract` (40 programs);
- each app's smoke, as `scripts/smoke.mjs` drives it;
- the roster's oracle tables (`runner/tests/it/format.rs`, `runner/src/stdlib.rs`'s tests);
- every rendered route's document (D6).

**The harness:** one agent script (`tree`, `tap`, `type`, `clock`, `state`,
`logs`) run by `scripts/agent.mjs` against the Rust runner on the headless
Linux host and against the JavaScript runner in headless Chrome, with the
outputs compared. The clock is in the script, so timers and settlement
compare exactly. It runs per commit on the async lane, not as a sixth
blocking check.

**Byte-identical** (a difference is a bug in one runner):
- slot values after every operation, in canonical value bytes (LLP 1005 §3);
- the requests sent across the seam: source, arguments, method, URL, headers;
- the roster's outputs over its fixtures;
- the canonical document of every route (LLP 1048 D1's digest, ids excluded);
- the router's locations and URLs;
- the order of events, action effects, timer firings and armed `then`s
  (LLP 1016.001) under the seekable clock, and where a refusal stops an
  advance: a `clock` step the wasm runner refuses, the others refuse too.

**Spec-equivalent** (held to a written rule, compared by effect):
- CSS: classes and inline styles instead of per-node declarations, compared
  by computed style in Chrome;
- the moment effects reach the DOM within a turn;
- error and log wording: codes in the JavaScript runtime;
- node identity in `tree`: plan sites and keys, not the Rust runner's counter
  ids (`runner/src/instance.rs:219-222`);
- performance and memory.

**Cheaper than it sounds.** Values are already JavaScript's: numbers are
binary64 (`plan/src/value.rs:17-18`), `length` counts UTF-16 code units
(`runner/src/stdlib.rs:130-134`), numbers print at JavaScript's boundaries
(`runner/src/stdlib.rs:252-253`), and formatting is `Intl`'s `en-US`
(`runner/src/format.rs:10-11`). The Rust roster was built to the browser's
oracle; the JavaScript one calls the oracle.

## 5. What it gives up

1. **One engine on every host.** Native keeps the Rust runner; the web gets a
   JavaScript runner. They are held equal by §4, not by construction. Every
   runner feature is built twice. I am ~90% confident this is unavoidable at
   20 KB: any shared engine is either an interpreter (wasm3-class, 60–100 KB,
   before a runner) or Rust in wasm (§2's floor).
2. **Plans as validated untrusted data on the web.** The web ships code. A
   plan is validated at build, and the web artifact is JavaScript like any
   site's. Web OTA becomes ordinary JavaScript delivery. Native delivery (LLP
   1030) is unchanged.
3. **Rust data sources cost bytes on the web.** A Rust module (Caltrain's
   `caltrain-logic`, `apps/caltrain/app.json:22`) ships as its own wasm, with
   no runner or kernel, loaded on first need. When the checkpoint holds its
   answers, that need comes after first interaction. TypeScript is the
   zero-cost default there, as LLP 1027 made it the default for logic.
4. **Byte-identical formatting by construction.** Every roster function needs
   a written spec and shared fixtures (§4). `Intl` can differ across browser
   versions where the Rust tables don't.
5. **Inspection in the shipped bundle.** The agent's operations are a
   development module. The smoked artifact is the shipped artifact plus that
   module, which is LLP 1047 §9 Q3's trade answered the other way.

Also given up:
- **The dev loop's single runner.** The web loop runs the JavaScript runner,
  so a native-only bug is found on the async lane, not in the seconds loop.
- **The letter of DEFERRED §Authoring models.** "Nothing runs JavaScript above
  [the seam] — not in Contract, not in the tree." Authors still write no
  JavaScript, but the tree is now driven by generated JavaScript. That is a
  DEFERRED trade (§8).

## 6. What stays

- **The native hosts,** Apple and Linux, with the Rust runner, kernel and
  Taffy: unchanged.
- **Contract,** the language and the compiler through the plan: unchanged.
- **One source.** An app is one `app.contract` and its data modules, for four
  surfaces.
- **The plan** as the one interface, and the conformance currency.
- **The renderer** (LLP 1048): documents, checkpoints, caching, the capture
  script.
- **The data seam** (LLP 1016, 1027): sources, requests as values, grants, the
  store, the TypeScript module in its realm.
- **The agent's nine operations,** on every host.
- **CSS as the standard.** `css.rs` still decides every row's CSS, at build.

## 7. The spike

Branch `exact3-web-spike`. It measured the claim; after §8's ruling it landed on main as `host/web-js`.

1. **The backend.** `contract` gains a JavaScript emitter over the validated
   plan (D1), enough for the video player: components, slots, actions,
   `when`, text and attribute bindings, `input`, `video`, `focus`.
2. **The runtime** (D2–D4): signals, delegation, regions, timers, the roster
   pieces the player calls.
3. **The stylesheet** (D3) from `css.rs` at build.
4. **The video player,** run by `scripts/agent.mjs web` with its smoke.
   Measure bytes (brotli-11, runtime and generated code apart) and
   time-to-interactive on the bench's mobile profile (150 ms RTT, 1.6 Mbps,
   4× CPU).
5. **Caltrain:** keyed lists, the router, resources, search, theming,
   adoption of its served pages (D6, first form). Its Rust logic runs two
   ways, measured apart: as its own lazily loaded wasm, and as LLP 1027's
   byte-identical TypeScript port (`1027:1599-1848`).
6. **Conformance:** both apps' smokes, and the corpus programs they touch,
   compared across the two runners (§4).

**What would confirm the estimate:** the video player ≤ 15 KB brotli for
first interaction, Caltrain ≤ 25 KB before its data module, and runtime-up at
or under React SSR's ~950 ms.

**What would stop it:** generated code above 3× the plan's brotli size, a
runtime above 12 KB, or a Caltrain semantic that can't be matched without
reimplementing the kernel. Any failing measurement gets three rounds, then a
report.

### Spike results

Branch `exact3-web-spike`, 2026-09-28. Numbers are measured on an
Apple-silicon Mac with headless Chrome 154 unless marked *estimate*. Sizes are
brotli-11 unless marked.

**Decision recorded (Charlie, 2026-09-28):** pre-rendering "keep both
options available to allow for different deployment scenarios, but Rust
should be the primary/default." The build takes `--render rust|js`, default
`rust`: (a) the Rust render host (`exact_render`) writes the page over the
JavaScript runtime's shell and the runtime adopts it; (b) the generated
JavaScript renders the same page under Bun (`host/web-js/render.mjs`) for JS
edge runtimes and TypeScript-heavy deployments.

**What was built.**
- `exact-web-js js <app.contract | baked app.plan>`: the plan's bytecode to
  JavaScript (structured forward jumps as labeled blocks), the view as DOM
  construction, static rows to a class stylesheet computed by the web
  host's own `tag_for`/`props_for`/`css_text`/`host_css` (a new
  `exact_web::host::template::parts`), dynamic style units read from
  `css_text` itself.
- `host/web-js/rt.js`: signals, commits with rollback on refusal, a
  settlement pass, typed writes, resources with tickets and LLP
  1054.000.000's kept requests, mutations (`send`, `pending`, declared
  refreshes, `then` on the timer path), the durable store, row slots, `when`/`match`/keyed
  `each`, timers on the driver's clock, placeholders, the router
  (`route/src` ported; the web host's `navigation.js` reused for history),
  adoption from a checkpoint, capture and replay, Markdown as a loaded
  capability (the web host's pieces in a 24 KB wasm, `renderMarkup`
  reused).
- Data: TypeScript `app.ts` bundled into the page (RealWorld); Rust sources
  through their logic module over ABI 3 after first paint (Caltrain's own
  module, or one generated from the DataSource an app's web build bakes).
- `host/web-js/conform.mjs`: the conformance harness (§4 below), and
  `host/web-js/bench.mjs` / `render-bench.mjs` for the numbers here.

**Conformance.** The same plan through the Rust web runner and the
JavaScript runner in one Chrome, driven by the same `scripts/agent.mjs`
operations; after each step the typed state, the tree, layout boxes by
testId and a screenshot are compared; `app.test.contract` files run on both.
- RealWorld (a scripted scenario against the hosted API: an article with
  Markdown, history back, a tag, the global feed, a failed sign-in, the
  auth pages): 16 steps compared, all equal after the fixes the harness
  found.
- Caltrain: state, tree and layout equal (158 testIds within 0.01 px);
  screenshots differ only where the GPU surfaces are (not built yet);
  `app.test.contract` 3/3 on both. Video player and completion-storm:
  every step equal. Four synthetic plans (regions and keyed reorders, row
  slots, dynamic styles, timers): every step equal.
- Adoption: a page from either renderer, adopted, against a fresh
  JavaScript render: every step equal (RealWorld).
- Other in-repo apps are refused at build by named features not yet
  compiled (native modules, dynamic SVG paint and clip-path, keyframe
  animations, virtualized lists, `reachstart`, dynamic `line-height`):
  the harness lists each (see the full run in the spike report).

**RealWorld, the headline** (`bench.mjs`, LLP 1047.000 §1's method: mobile
profile, 150 ms RTT, 1.6 Mbps, 4× CPU, cold profile per run, 5 runs,
medians; pages served per request against api.realworld.show, `cached`
routes kept at the origin; the press is the sign-in form's submit on
`/login`, since signed out every press on `/` is a link):

| ms / bytes | exact2 served (wasm) | JS, Rust-rendered (a) | JS, JS-rendered (b) | JS, client only |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FCP, `/` | 400 | 420 | 316 | 752 |
| Content painted, `/` | 400 | 420 | 316 | 1,201 |
| Tag tapped at `load` → feed | 1,140 | 1,111 | 879 | (no tag on screen at `load`) |
| Runtime up, after a press at `load` | 2,329 | 652 | 661 | 678 |
| A press that needs the runtime, at `load` → effect | 3,084 | 1,440 | 1,431 | 1,469 |
| Origin bytes before content | 6,979 | 7,892 | 7,032 | 22,092 |
| Origin bytes before the press answered | 340,164 | 24,413 | 23,762 | 22,092 |

The React SPA and SSR columns wait for the React bench, which isn't on this
machine; `bench.mjs --config` takes their selectors. LLP 1047.000 §1's React
SSR figure for runtime-up was ~950 ms on its own machine and network.

**Bytes before interactive, growth by step** (fresh page, JS target):

| brotli B | spike | + semantics, router, adoption (steps 1–3) |
|---|---|---|
| Video player: runtime share + generated code | 2,099 + ~940 | 3,738 + ~1,030 |
| Video player: page + `app.js` | 4,273 | 6,006 |
| Caltrain: runtime share | 3,295 | 7,315 |
| Caltrain: `app.js` (runtime, generated, router, `navigation.js`) | 7,367 | 13,239 |
| Caltrain: pre-rendered page | — (client-rendered) | 6,054 (a) / 5,292 (b) |
| RealWorld: `app.js` (with `app.ts` and the router) | — | 19,152 |

**Time to interactive, the same method as before** (a press retried until it
answers; cold; unthrottled / 4× CPU with 150 ms and 1.6 Mbps):

| ms | spike | now | exact2 wasm |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video player | 69 / 610 | 59 / 583 | 102 / 2,022 |
| Caltrain | 89 / 602 (FCP 524) | 71 / 640 (FCP 300, pre-rendered) | 267 / 2,728 (FCP 384) |

**The two renderers** (`render-bench.mjs`: every request renders,
`Cache-Control: no-store`; `rust` is the native render host, one render
worker for Caltrain, four for RealWorld; `js` is one Bun process; after the
render-host fixes below):

| | Caltrain `/` rust | Caltrain `/` js | RealWorld `/` rust (warm realms) | RealWorld `/` js | RealWorld article rust (warm) | RealWorld article js |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cold start → first page (ms) | 151 (10 when hot on disk) | 25–32 | 545 | 559 | 522 | 565 |
| Latency p50 / p95 (ms), concurrency 1 | 2 / 2 | 4 / 5 | — | — | — | — |
| Latency p50 / p95 (ms), concurrency 32 or 4 | 46 / 48 | 111 / 118 | 174 / 189 | 176 / 524 | 174 / 186 | 175 / 525 |
| CPU per page (ms) | 2.4–2.5 | 7.7–10.9 | 6.7 (7.9 fresh realms) | 14.2 | 6.3 (7.5 fresh) | 14.2 |
| Throughput (pages/s) | 688 at 32 | 285 at 32 | 22.5 at 4 | 17.2 at 4 | 22.4 at 4 | 17.2 at 4 |

What changed in the render host, measured before and after:
- **The accept loop polled** with a 10 ms sleep, which an idle macOS
  process's timer coalescing stretched to 60–70 ms before a request was
  accepted: Caltrain's p50 at concurrency 1 went from 48 ms to 2 ms with a
  blocking accept (a drain wakes it with its own connection). TCP_NODELAY is
  set too; alone it changed nothing.
- **A fresh executor per render** meant a new TLS connection to the API for
  every source: a worker now keeps the executors of renders that settled.
  RealWorld's p50 went from 528–554 ms to 174–181 ms and its CPU per page
  from 16 ms to about 5–8 ms.
- **The first table's CPU was mostly brotli-11** of each re-kept page (a
  `no-cache` request re-renders and re-keeps a `cached` route); `no-store`
  renders without keeping.
- **Warm realms** (`EXACT_RENDER_REALMS=warm`) render the next page with the
  last settled data source instead of a new module realm, about 1.2 ms less
  CPU per page. It relaxes LLP 1048.000 D10's fresh realm per render, so it
  is off by default and is for anonymous pages only.
- (a) as wasm on a JS edge runtime, *estimate*: the render host's core is
  about the size of `app.wasm` (~290 KB brotli) plus the app's data module,
  and its TypeScript sources would need the edge runtime's own engine
  through host calls. Not built.

**(a) against (b).**

| | (a) Rust render host, JS adopts | (b) JS under Bun, JS adopts |
|---|---|---|
| First paint / TTI | FCP 420 ms; runtime up 652 ms (RealWorld, mobile) | FCP 316 ms; runtime up 661 ms |
| Bytes before interactive | page 7.9 KB (inline styles, og metas) + the same `app.js` | page 7.0 KB (classes) + the same `app.js` |
| Adoption code | the same cursor walk, which also strips inline styles and view ids | the same cursor walk |
| Build time (Caltrain, warm) | ~1.0 s (a release render binary: ~52 s cold) | ~0.5 s |
| Adoption correctness | fresh-vs-adopted: every step equal | every step equal |
| A resource that answers later | the checkpoint lists it pending; the runtime asks after adoption | the same, from the runtime's own tickets |
| Documents (1048.003) | the head, canonical, og, robots, status, sitemap, 404 are the render host's | title, description and 404 only; the rest is a gap |
| Single source of truth | two renderers of one plan; the harness guards parity | one implementation renders and adopts |
| Per-request CPU | 2.4 ms (Caltrain), 6–8 ms (RealWorld) | 8–11 ms (Caltrain), 14 ms (RealWorld) |
| Per-request latency | Caltrain 2 ms; RealWorld p95 186 ms | Caltrain 4 ms; RealWorld p95 525 ms |

**Recommendation.** Keep (a) as the default, as ruled. After the fixes
above it is ahead of (b) on every per-request row: about a third of the
CPU, two to three times Caltrain's throughput, a third higher RealWorld
throughput and a flat p95. It is also the renderer native hosts and the
documents code already trust, and the harness holds its pages to the
JavaScript runtime's DOM. Keep (b) for JS edge runtimes and
TypeScript-heavy deployments where a native binary can't run. The remaining
gap is (b)'s documents: head fields, canonical URLs and sitemaps come only
from (a) today.

**Steps 4 and 5: the router and loaded capabilities** (measured after both):
- **Router.** `route/src`'s table, chain and six verbs are ported; history is
  the web host's own `navigation.js`. A synthetic plan (tabs, a deep chain,
  parameters, a query, a modal, refused verbs, history back, reselecting a
  tab) is equal to the Rust runner on all 20 steps; RealWorld's scenario on
  all 21.
- **GPU surfaces** run through the web host's `gpu-glue.js` over the app's
  own `gpu.js`/`gpu_bg.wasm`, fetched after the first painted frame, only
  when a canvas is on the page (as the wasm build loads them: 12.3 + 12.6 +
  102.3 KB brotli for Caltrain). Caltrain's aurora and Weatherlight's sky
  render as the wasm build does; Weatherlight (TypeScript and GPU) is equal
  on all 8 steps.
- **Motion.** `@keyframes` from the plan are in the stylesheet, and CSS
  animations are held to the agent's clock; Motion Gallery's keyframe tiles
  now match. Springs, presence and layout transitions (`motion-glue.js`)
  are not wired.
- **Bytes and time after step 5** (brotli; mobile profile): video player
  6,107 before interactive, 605 ms to answer (wasm 1,976); Caltrain 20,110
  before interactive (page 6,054 + `app.js` 13,655), 640 ms, FCP 380 ms
  (wasm 2,716, FCP 384); RealWorld `app.js` 19,172.

**Conformance, the last full run** (every app with a wasm build, `conform.mjs`):

| | apps |
|---|---|
| every step equal | RealWorld 21/21, Weatherlight 8/8, completion-storm 8/8, video player 4/4, Caltrain 12/12, Typetour 12/12, Carousel 16/16, Sparkline 4/4 and SVG Gallery 12/12 (since 2026-09-29, below); synthetic: router 20/20, regions 8/8, rows 7/7, styles 4/4, composite 3/3, timers 3/3, lists 14/14 |
| every step equal since animated images are held (2026-09-29, "Retiring…", step e) | Motion Gallery 4/4 |
| every step equal, since the build gaps closed (2026-09-29, below) | Canvas Gallery 9/9, Update Lab 7/7, native-fixture 7/7, photo-editor 4/4, map-demo 5/5, recorder 3/3, Fieldnotes 10/10, Markdown 5/5 |
| refused at build, by name | none in `apps/` |

**What is left, estimated** (*estimates*, runtime bytes brotli):

| Gap | Work | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Reorder on a virtualized list~~ landed 2026-09-29 (below) | — | — |
| Animated images on the agent's clock (`image-glue.js`) | 1 day | loaded |
| ~~Dynamic composite rows (clip-path, SVG paint, animation, timeline scope)~~ and ~~the rest~~ landed 2026-09-29 (below) | — | — |
| ~~Text around shapes (`wrap-flow`, LLP 1043.000)~~ landed 2026-09-29 (below) | — | — |
| Events: ~~pan, panrelease, swiperight, select, cancel, the height, transform and reorder drags~~ (landed 2026-09-29, below); ~~a file input and `showPicker`~~ (landed 2026-09-29, "Files and storage") | — | — |
| (b)'s documents: canonical, og, robots, status, sitemap | 2–3 days | build-time only |
| State carried across a dev reload (the loop rebuilds and reloads), the rest of the agent (`stages`, plan swap); delivery needs no client on the web: `exactDelivery` answers what the build baked and there is no update store for `deliveryCheck`/`deliveryActivate` to act on (below, "Delivery on the web") | 1–2 weeks | agent-only / <1 KB |

### The tools (2026-09-29)

The tools that drive a web app run what `host/web/build.mjs` makes, so an
app the JS target takes is developed, driven and measured on the runtime it
ships. A JS build's completion marker (`.exact-build.json`) says
`target: 'js'` and lists its files; the local servers serve it as a tree
(`serve.mjs` `buildTreeFile`: no dot path, no symlink), since its chunks are
content-named.

| Tool | Target | How |
|---|---|---|
| Dev loop (`host/web/dev.mjs`) | JS (a refusal shows in the page) | `host/web-js/dev.mjs`: an edit under the app, `host/web-js` or the base stylesheet rebuilds (`host/web-js/build.mjs --render none` into a stage renamed over dist; what did not change is not rebuilt) and every page reloads; a failed build's errors show in the page, which keeps the last good build. Edit → first frame 104 ms p50 for the video player (was ~2.2 s), 307 ms for Caltrain, whose first frame waits for its Rust module (below, "Build and toolchain gaps"), against the resident wasm loop's ~20 ms and the 100 ms budget row; no slot values carried. `--wasm`, or a refusal, runs the resident loop |
| Delivery (`scripts/deploy.mjs`) | the web root JS when it takes the app | the production wasm bake stays the streams' bundle and receipts; its baked plan compiled to JS (`--production`) is the web root (below, "Delivery on the web") |
| Agent, web host (`scripts/agent.mjs web`) | what dist holds | a JS dist is served as a tree; the tree reply carries `roots`, the journal a `boot:` line |
| Smoke (`smoke.mjs web`), the app drive and its tests | the default build | the staged-core check is the wasm's only |
| Metrics: bytes, browser startup, dev loop, `--rebuild` | the default build | a JS build reports `app.js` bytes; the dev row times five edits across the reload |
| `serve.mjs` | what dist holds | a JS dist as a tree |

What stays on the wasm target, and why:

- **Delivery's bake** (`deploy.mjs`): the production wasm bake is still what
  makes the streams' signed bundle — the baked plan, the assets, the
  production-trust receipt — which the web root now shares (below,
  "Delivery on the web"); only the root's program moved.
- **Native clients on the dev URL** (`build.mjs --url`, `/__dev/open`,
  `exact run`'s live plan): they read the resident loop's envelope and dev
  generations (LLP 1023), which the JS loop does not serve, by decision
  (below, "Native clients' live reload"); it answers them with a 404 naming
  `--wasm`.
- **The smoke's bare-plan fixtures and router sweep**: they swap arbitrary
  plans into a running page (`--plan`, `exact.reload`); the JS target
  compiles one plan ahead of time. `agent.mjs --plan` refuses a JS dist by
  name.
- **`motionparity`**: it takes Chrome as the reference for animated images
  on the agent's clock (`image-glue.js`, a gap above). `canvasparity` takes
  the JS build since the JS agent reports `state.canvas` ("Retiring the wasm
  target on the web").
- **Conformance** (`conform.mjs`): the wasm run is the oracle it compares against.
- **Metrics `--long`'s web bytes**: the wasm's code by capability (LLP 1047 D9).

Found on the way (2026-09-29): the runtime now answers `exactTime`, the
runner's reserved source, itself (`data.reserved`, from `navigation.js`'s
reporters; `resolvedLocale` is `""`, the no-tables answer), which
`auth-fixture`'s `time` resource needed. (Its auth session and `now()`
readers closed the same day: "The runtime gaps" below.) RealWorld's `tap submit` difference was the
harness: its auto-taps compared before a press's fetch (the hosted API)
landed; they now settle first, as scripted steps do.

**Canvas 2D surfaces and declared fonts** (landed 2026-09-29, measured;
brotli):
- **Canvas 2D** (a Rust source's surfaces). The module exports its draws
  beside the ABI (`exact_logic_abi::export_draw!`, `logic/abi/src/draw.rs`:
  op 5, one recorder per canvas generation, the runner's `DataSource::draw`
  unchanged). `rt.js` `c2` keeps each canvas's arguments; `canvas2d.js`, a
  chunk fetched two frames after the first 2D canvas mounts, is the runner's
  half of LLP 1056 D4 (geometry and size generations, causes, frames, fonts)
  over the wasm host's own `canvas2d-glue.js`, unchanged. Cost: 180 B in
  Caltrain's `app.js` (the hook, only where a 2D canvas is), 5,687 B loaded
  (the chunk: 4,014 the glue, the rest the engine and the draw client), 28 B in `rust-data.js`; the module
  grows by the draw code and the recorder it now links, 10.5 KB for
  Caltrain's (35,769 → 46,265, a size build; app.wasm carries the same code).
  TypeScript draws landed later the same day (below); not carried: a Rust draw's `measureText`
  and images (no text engine or image table crosses the seam).
- **Declared fonts** cost the runtime nothing: each face is an `@font-face`
  rule in the build's stylesheet under the web host's family name, with
  `font-display: optional` — the wasm host's own policy (a face not ready in
  about 100 ms stays unused, no swap after paint) — and a preload in the
  shell's head, which a server's early flush sends; a rendered page's head
  drops the render's own copies. Typetour: 171 B of rules and preloads in its shell; the faces themselves are the bytes the wasm host loads too.
- **Caltrain** (mobile profile, 5 cold runs, medians; JS / wasm): FCP
  384–400 / 360–404 ms, runtime up 633–649 / 2,727–2,764 ms, 18,849 /
  337,240 bytes before interactive (page 4,888 + `app.js` 13,961).

**Virtualized lists** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli):
- **What.** `host/web-js/list.js` is the runner's half of LLP 1010 §6,
  1050.000 §6 and 1070, ported from `runner/src/instance/collection`: the
  size index (the sum tree, measurement epochs and tokens), the window led by
  travel, bootstrap rows before the first report, anchoring across data
  changes, first measurements and restored positions, the fill limit and
  retirement, `reachstart`/`reachend` armed by geometry with the end held
  behind the start's requests, `scrollFollowEnd`, authored
  `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft` built before the port moves, and one level of
  nesting with kept positions and pins. Rows are keyed and made fresh, not
  recycled, as the runner's are; the wrappers and spacers are
  `views.rs`'s, so the tree, the boxes and the pixels match. The browser
  half is the wasm host's `collection-glue.js`, unchanged but for handing
  its report's facts to the JS runner as values beside the wire bytes.
- **Cost.** `list.js` is 6.4 KB, in the module only when the plan has a
  virtualized list; `collection-glue.js` 4.9 KB, fetched after the first
  paint, as the wasm build fetches it. An app without a list pays 199 B in
  `rt.js` (the video player, 4,751 → 4,950 B `app.js`): the commit hook,
  the no-op count an edge reads, and authored scroll offsets, which every
  app needed (a dynamic `scrollTop` was written as an attribute).
- **Conformance.** Carousel 16/16, its scripted scroll of 25,000 cards and
  its feed of nested strips and inboxes; synthetic lists 14/14, a long list
  scrolled to both edges (each grows it; the start's rows come above,
  anchored), an authored jump and a transcript following its end. A press
  on a page with a list is compared once both have settled, since a list
  builds in the frames after it. Found: a wheel-scrolled list whose rows
  differ from their estimate is not repeatable across two runs, on either
  target: which rows a moving port builds ahead of itself, and so which it
  has measured, is the frame clock's. The fixture's long list uses rows at
  its estimate.
- **Not carried**, refused by name (reorder landed later that day, below): a dynamic
  `virtualized`. (`scrollIntoView` landed the same day: below.)

**Bluesky** (outside the repo, `EXACT_APP_DIR`; 2026-09-29): it builds on the
JS target and its timeline, a thread, a profile, sign-in (the `demo`
account) and notifications work in a browser.
- **What it took** (each a refusal or a failure it met): apps outside
  `apps/` (`host/web/build.mjs` no longer refuses them; the Rust module is
  built from the app's own data crate); the reserved source
  `exactViewport` (`facts.js`, the web host's own readings, re-answered on
  each resize; only where declared), and both it and `exactTime` answered
  by the page even where the bake compiled a value; symbol images (`symbols.js`, the web host's
  masks; a bound source's roles come from the plan's strings); the `scroll`
  event, and `refresh`, which the web does not deliver (no pull to refresh,
  as in the wasm host); dynamic `translate`, `line-height` and
  `aspect-ratio`, each one declaration as the author wrote it; a
  paragraph's inline runs as text nodes in the agent's tree. On Bluesky's
  side: `contains` → `includes`, the plan's `Items`, the lock.
- **Conformance** (a local scripted run, not the lane's: its first screen is
  the live network, and two loads a moment apart can get two Discover
  feeds): with the same feed, 9 of 11 steps equal. The two that differ are the
  spring gap: scrolling hides the header on a `translate` spring, and the
  wasm target's `clock settle` runs its clock across the spring, where a
  250 ms timer fires.
- **Measured** (realworld-bench's method and launcher, its `load`
  scenario: mobile profile, a cold browser each run, 5 runs, medians; both

  The JS target's remaining weight is the data seam's: Bluesky's AT
  Protocol client as its own wasm, bound with the whole plan. Binding it with
  only what it reads (its sources and shapes) is a lever not yet taken; the
  module itself is the app's code.

**Dynamic composite rows and SVG** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli):
- **What.** A dynamic row whose grammar is CSS's own is one declaration as
  the author wrote it (style.rs `style_writes`): `clip-path` (only `none`,
  `url()` and `path()`, the kernel's grammar; any other shape is unset),
  `shape-outside`, SVG `fill`/`stroke` and dashes, `filter`,
  `transform-origin`, `paint-order`, gradients; `animation` over the plan's
  `@keyframes` (paused again under an `animation-timeline`, whose shorthand
  would reset the play state); the timeline rows as css.rs writes them
  (`timeline-scope` with its `--exact-timeline-scope`, the drag and
  animation timelines' custom properties); an eased `transition`. Refused by
  name: a dynamic SVG `transform` (SVG's syntax, which the kernel restates as
  CSS), a marker, and any value that can be `url(#…)` (the kernel scopes ids
  per instance), `animation` or `transition` on a node whose press feedback
  scales (`--exact-scale`), and a `transition` that can be a spring.
- **Found and fixed.** The compiler never linked the host's grammars
  (`exact_web::link`), so a *static* `animation`, `clip-path`, `filter`,
  gradient or drag timeline row was left out of the stylesheet: Motion
  Gallery's keyframe tiles ran on no rule (its stylesheet +148 B). SVG
  elements were made in SVG's namespace by a tag list that lacked `defs`,
  gradients, `stop`, `clipPath`, `mask`, `marker`, `pattern`, `use`,
  `symbol`, `text` and the filters: the compiler now says (`hs`, from the
  node type), which took 51 B off every app's module (the video player
  4,954 → 4,903 B `app.js`). A `symbol`'s content carries its rows inline
  too, since Chrome styles `use` clones without the page's class rules. The
  agent held every CSS animation at the clock's time from zero; it now
  keeps each from the time it began, author-paused ones at their own, and
  `clock settle` runs the clock to where the last one ends, as the wasm
  host's `animationClock` does (agent-only bytes).
- **Cost.** Only a plan with such a row pays: a `S(e, prop, "", f)` per row,
  plus a small mapping function for `clip-path`, `animation`, the timeline
  rows. Sparkline 15,262 B `app.js`, SVG Gallery 12,331 B (page 4,186).
- **Conformance.** Sparkline 4/4, SVG Gallery 12/12, and a synthetic
  `composite.contract` (over SVG Gallery's dist, which links the grammars)
  3/3; both apps join the async lane's run.

**The runtime gaps** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli-11, `app.js`
bytes against a plan without the feature):
- **`now()`.** A reader of `now()` is re-evaluated at each commit made at a
  later time, as the runner's dependency tracking marks a clock read
  (`instance/deps.rs`), and never by the clock moving alone: `x_now` reads a
  node each commit stamps. Outside the agent the clock is the page's elapsed
  time, stamped at an input or reply commit; a timer commits at its due
  time; a render's clock carries into the page. Bluesky's relative times
  follow the clock (its minute-rounded `clock` derive feeds its resources:
  "2m" became "1h", "32m" "42m" across two clock moves). About 65 B in
  every app.
- **The reserved sources** (`facts.js`, each answered by its readers'
  declared fields, imported only where declared): `exactPage` from the web
  host's own `pageReporter` (visibility, online, share sheet; the agent's
  `prefer page`), +672 B; `exactDelivery` as the build baked it (a JS build
  links no update store; `deliveryCheck` and `deliveryActivate` stay a
  gap), +178 B; `exactSurface`, a GPU module's published record decoded
  against each reader's shape as `surface_record.rs` decodes it, +549 B.
- **Localized strings** (LLP 1060): the tables in the module, the locale
  slot at the base for initializers and then the table the page's locale
  reads, with `exactTime` answered again, as the runner's first
  `set_place`; `t` fills MF2 simple messages; the resolved table sets
  `lang` and `dir`; `exactTime.resolvedLocale` names it. +625 B with two
  one-key tables.
- **`openAuthSession`** (`auth.js`, `runner/src/auth.rs`'s rules: the
  request's checks, the grants, one session per window and supersession,
  the callback's match): held under the agent (`pending`, `clock settle`
  stops with reason `device`, `tap @t cancel` / `type @t <url>`), else a
  popup opened in the press's own call stack by the web host's
  `auth-glue.js`. The store keeps keys as the web host does
  (`storage-environment.js`, fetched on first use). The auth-fixture smoke
  on the JS target: 14/14 under the agent, 4/4 through the popup (opener,
  and COOP's BroadcastChannel). Auth Fixture's `app.js` 8,935 → 11,238 B;
  `auth-glue.js` 761 B and `storage-environment.js` 531 B loaded;
  `serve.mjs` serves `/.exact/auth/…` from a JS build.
- **`scrollIntoView` on a virtualized list** (`list.js`, `into_view.rs`
  ported): the command and the agent's `tap <list> into <key>`, aligned as
  `Element.scrollIntoView()` aligns, built at the destination before the
  port moves, corrected until it holds (`done`, `unconverged`,
  `cancelled`, refusals), an inner list through its outer row; `state`
  lists each request. `list.js` 6,583 → 7,662 B (+1,079). Reorder stays a
  gap: it is a drag, on the motion capability.
- **The RealWorld `wheel 1 -4000` flake** was not the JS target: macOS's
  elastic overscroll bounces a page wheeled past its edge on the
  compositor's clock, and a screenshot could catch either target 1-10 px
  low mid-bounce (the wasm page in 2 of 4 runs), while layout agreed. The
  agent's documents set `overscroll-behavior: none` on the root: 6 of 6
  equal.
- **Conformance** (new synthetic plans): clock 10/10, locale 4/4 (a
  lagging `en-US` table, an rtl table, an escape, the three facts, an
  unpublished surface), intoview 10/10; the auth fixture is its smoke,
  since it needs its local authorization server.
- **`exactTime` across a DST change** (landed later the same day): after
  each clock move the agent answers `exactTime` again where its answer
  changed, the offset at the new virtual instant, as the wasm host's
  `exact_set_time` after `clock` does (agent-only bytes). Synthetic
  `dst.contract` (Los Angeles an hour before the 2026-03-08 change; a plan's
  `// agent: timeZone=… epoch=…` line is the drive's facts on both).

**Motion: springs, holds, swipes and pans** (landed 2026-09-29, measured;
brotli):
- **What.** One motion piece, fetched two frames after first paint by a
  plan that uses motion (as the wasm host's is): `motion.wasm`, the
  `exact_motion` Engine every host runs behind a numeric ABI
  (`host/web-js/motion`, tested natively in the blocking checks), the web
  host's own `motion-glue.js`, unchanged, and `motion.js` between them, the
  runner's half. The kernel's motion seam is the compiler's: a node a swipe
  holds, a swipe's indicator, or one whose `transition` can be a spring is
  registered (`mo`), and each commit that changes its `translate`, `scale`,
  `rotate`, `opacity` or `transition` tells the engine (the kernel's
  `motion_sync`); after each commit the engine lowers what started, and a
  spring plays as the frames the wasm host would send (`animate` with
  `at`). A dynamic `transition` is written with its springs left out, as
  css.rs writes one. A hold (motion-glue `begin`/`move`/`release`) is the
  engine's; a dynamic style row on a held node goes to the authored text the
  hold restores (`Sm`, the wasm host's `style` op). `swiperight` is
  motion-glue's `attachSwipe` (the precedence rule 3's pending contact, the
  knee, the indicator's companions), its action run while its hold owns the
  row (`Host::dispatch_held`). `pan` is the web host's own `input-glue.js`
  (fetched after first paint, one coalesced action per frame, rule 3's
  boundary and rule 4's click suppression), `panrelease` its release at the
  engine's tracker's velocity (LLP 1057 §10.6). Under the agent, `clock
  settle` runs to the last spring's end (`settleAt`), as the wasm host's does.
- **Cost.** Nothing for a plan without motion (the video player's `app.js`
  4,903 → 4,901 B). Loaded after first paint: `motion.wasm` 38,878 B (the
  Engine, its transition and animation grammars and spring sampling; the
  wasm host carries the same code in `app.wasm`), the motion chunk 13,159 B
  (`motion-glue.js`, 1,111 lines, is most of it), `input-glue.js` 2,016 B.
  In `app.js`: Spark 14,407 B (the registration and the loaders), Messages
  Stress 15,007 B.
- **Conformance.** Spark 12/12 with scripted fingers (`drag` steps, a real
  touch contact over real time: throws by position and by velocity, one
  that springs home, a super like, a photo tap on a panning node, the undo
  spring back); it joins the async lane. Messages Stress: its three swipes
  equal (past the knee, short of it, vertical), and Messages' two, on
  their scripted steps; neither joins the lane (below).
- **Found.** Messages Stress's auto-tapped `toggle-windowed` at 100,000
  records differs (the JS list's supplied records 200, the wasm's 100,000)
  and the wasm page stops answering on `toggle-eager`. Messages' closed
  popovers (`filter-messages`, the recover and purge confirmations) have
  boxes in the wasm page's layout and none in the JS page's. Bluesky's header
  spring now builds on the JS target (b5cc1550 refused it for a day).

**`select`, `cancel` and the Markdown editor** (landed 2026-09-29, measured;
brotli):
- **What.** A `textarea markup="markdown"` is the web host's own editor
  (LLP 1045 D5): `markup-editor.js`, unchanged, fetched at the first one,
  over `markup-editor.wasm`, built from `exact-markdown-editor` as the wasm
  build builds it. It replaces the text field, which then forwards to it
  what the runtime writes and listens for (its value, attributes and style,
  its events), and its view id moves to the editor. `select` is the editor's
  facts at each selection change, the runner's `Event::Select` record; the
  `format` command runs the editor's. The DOM's `cancel` is carried as any
  event; its producers, a file input's picker and `showPicker`, landed
  later ("Files and storage").
- **Cost.** 486 B in `app.js` for a plan with an editor (`mde`,
  `onSelect`, nothing for any other); loaded at the first editor: the chunk
  5,309 B, `markup-editor.wasm` 40,233 B (the wasm host's own). For
  comparison, the motion registration and its events are 725 B in a plan's
  `app.js` (`mo`, `onSwipe`, `onPan`, `onPanRelease`, `Sm`).
- **Conformance.** Markdown Stress 17/17, with a scripted editor (the
  single-document mode, a tap in the editor, three toolbar formats); it
  joins the async lane.

**Text around shapes** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli):
- **What.** Until now the JS target wrote `wrap-flow` as CSS, which lays
  out no exclusion: Reflow's and Text Flow's prose ran under their shapes.
  A node with the row now registers (`wf`), and a plan with one fetches,
  after first paint, the web host's own exclusions executor
  (`textflow-glue.js` and `timer-glue.js`, unchanged, over `textflow.wasm`,
  `exact-textflow`'s `textflow-web` as the wasm build builds it) and
  `flow.js`, the runner's half the wasm host keeps in Rust: which nodes are
  exclusions (absolutely positioned, `both`) and the contexts they wrap
  (`flow_host.rs`'s `emit_textflow`), and the kernel's structural admission
  rule for an auto-height paragraph (`flow.rs`'s `structural_refusal`),
  read from the page's computed styles (`computedStyleMap` keeps a
  percentage as authored). Before each commit touches the tree, flowed
  paragraphs go back to their text (a `Before` hook, 12 B in every app's
  module), and after it the executor lays them out again. The agent reads
  a flowed paragraph's own text and runs, not its fragments.
- **Cost.** 336 B in `app.js` for a plan with the row (`wf`); loaded:
  `flow.js` with the executor 8,571 B, `textflow.wasm` 38,547 B (the wasm
  host's own). Reflow's `app.js` 10,927 B, Text Flow's 12,257 B.
- **Conformance.** Reflow 11/11 plus its dragon dragged twice (a `pan` on
  a clipped node, the prose re-flowing), Text Flow 10/10 plus an orb
  dragged; both join the async lane. A second orb's drag differed by
  3e-5 px in its slot: which frames a real-time finger's deltas fall in is
  the frame clock's, and `moveOrb` scales and clamps each delta, so the sum
  depends on the partition, on either target.

**The height and transform drags** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli):
- **What.** Both are motion-glue's (`attachHeightDrag`,
  `attachTransformDrag`, unchanged) over the motion piece, whose runner's
  half gains `host/web/src/height_drag.rs`'s and `transform_drag.rs`'s
  logic (`motion.js`, `transform.js`). The compiler resolves a handle's
  `heightDragFor` or `transformDragFor` as the kernel does, to the unique
  strict ancestor with that `id` (and, for a transform, its parent as the
  clip), and emits the handle bound to them (`onHeight`, `onTGeom`,
  `onTRelease`); a height owner tells the engine its numeric height and
  `transition` (`mh`), a transform target registers as a motion node. At
  each commit the one owner is chosen as the wasm host chooses it (the
  first valid, never stolen) and each handle's binding is published to
  motion-glue when it changes. A height drag holds the owner's height and
  runs `heightrelease` at the height shown and the engine's velocity over
  the heights shown; a transform drag holds the target's translate and
  scale as one pair (`motion.wasm` gains the pair holds), orders the
  page's geometry reports by sequence, runs `transformgeometry` when they
  change and `transformrelease` with the engine's three velocities, and
  refuses stale identities, sequences and tokens before any value, as the
  wasm host does. The kernel's structural checks of a transform target
  (a 100% border-box View in an `overflow: hidden` parent, no insets,
  centred origin) are the page's snapshot's in motion-glue, which refuses
  the same geometry.
- **Cost.** In `app.js`, the bindings over the motion registration: 73 B.
  Loaded: the motion chunk 13,159 → 15,018 B, `motion.wasm` 38,878 →
  42,256 B (the pair holds and height).
- **Conformance.** Synthetic `height.contract` 5/5 (up past the snap, down
  under it, a small hold) and `transform.contract` 5/5 (a pan that springs
  home, a pinch that zooms and stays, a pan of the zoomed photo), over
  Interaction Gallery's dist, which links the drags. Interaction Gallery
  and Exact Live still wait on the reorder drag.

**Presence: exit animations and layout transitions** (landed 2026-09-29,
measured; brotli):
- **What.** LLP 1063 on the web host's own `presence-glue.js`, unchanged,
  fetched two frames after first paint by a plan with either row (rt.js
  `pr`). The rows are the inline custom properties the glue reads from the
  element's own declaration, as the live host writes them (a class's
  custom property would be inherited). Each commit the glue measures the
  views that declare a layout transition before the tree changes and plays
  back each that moved (eased, or a spring it lowers itself); a region's
  removed root that declares an exit, the kernel's `exit`, stays where it
  was, out of flow at its last box, until its keyframes end: `clear` passes
  over it, since moving it would cancel its CSS animation. Under the agent
  both follow the driver's clock, `clock settle` runs to where the last one
  ends, the tree leaves the ghost out and `state` carries `presence`.
- **Cost.** A plan without either row: 20 B (the hooks). With them: +364 B
  `app.js` for the synthetic plan, `presence-glue.js` 3,366 B loaded.
- **Conformance.** Synthetic `presence.contract` (over SVG Gallery's dist,
  which links the animation grammars: an eased row leaving, a spring one,
  one coming back); driven mid-flight on both targets, every box, opacity
  and screenshot equal at +100, +120 and +150 ms, as well as settled.
- **Bluesky** (local, `EXACT_APP_DIR`, `conformance/bluesky-exact2.steps`):
  builds on the JS target and conforms 8/8 with the same feed, the header
  hiding and showing on its `translate` spring included — the two steps
  that differed.
- **A virtualized list's row** (landed later the same day): a row whose
  item left the data leaves as its wrapper, where the window placed it,
  with its root's exit animation (kernel `leaving_with`); one the window
  scrolls away leaves at once; the list's child order passes over it.
  `list.js` 7,662 → 7,758 B. Synthetic `listexit.contract` (over
  Sparkline's dist, which links collections and the animation grammars: a
  row in view, one built below the port), and driven mid-flight: boxes,
  opacity and screenshots equal at +120 ms.

**The end edge re-arms when rows are appended past it** (2026-09-29): the web
framework bench's feed stalled when a reader jumping to the bottom every 150 ms
reached the new end before a landed page's rows were measured. Both runners did
it, as LLP 1010 said they should; Charlie ruled (provisional) that rows appended
past the end re-arm `reachend` (the old last row kept, rows after it), and both
runners now do (LLP 1010's 2026-09-29 paragraph). `paging.contract` pins it: five pages, each landing taking the reader
to the new end. Found with it: in a long clock jump the JS target delivers list
feedback between timers (a jump's `$jump` reports at once), the wasm target
after them; the fixture's source is bounded, which hides it.

### Build and toolchain gaps (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli)

Every app in `apps/` that the backend compiles now builds on the JS target
with no wasm build beside it; what still builds wasm is refused for a
runtime feature (the events in the table above), not the build.
Conformance (`conform.mjs --build`, each against its wasm build): Caltrain
12/12 and Weatherlight 12/12 with their own GPU modules, Canvas Gallery
9/9, Update Lab 7/7, native-fixture 7/7, photo-editor 4/4, map-demo 5/5,
recorder 3/3.

- **The GPU module.** `host/web-js/build.mjs` builds the app's GPU crates
  itself, with the wasm build's own steps (`webGpuArtifacts`,
  `scripts/app.mjs`: the crate for wasm32 under the `web` profile,
  wasm-bindgen, wasm-opt; the wasm build calls the same function), cached
  under the app's target (`web-js-gpu`) with the shaders while Cargo's
  dep-info and the shader roots say nothing changed. Conformance no longer
  borrows the wasm build's module.
- **Canvas 2D drawn by a TypeScript source** (`host/web-js/ts-draw.js`):
  the app's `draw` with the bake's TypeScript recorder
  (`canvas/recorder.js`), one recorder per canvas generation as its
  `canvasSeam` keeps them, the lists handed to the glue as bytes (no seam,
  so no base64). Text is measured and images sized by the glue's own
  `canvas2dHost`, as the wasm host's module realm asks it; each image not
  yet loaded is counted in flight. Draws start once the page's declared
  faces have loaded, as a module arriving after first pixel finds them
  (Canvas Gallery's text fixtures draw on a kept context, so a `font`
  redraw doubled them). The recorder installs its `Path2D` as the global,
  as a draw expects; the page's glue replays with the browser's, so the
  global is the recorder's only during a draw. Found on the way: an
  explicit bitmap size (`bitmap-width`/`bitmap-height`) was dropped for
  Rust draws too; it is carried now (a dynamic one is refused). Cost: the
  2D chunk is 19.3 KB loaded for Canvas Gallery against 6.1 KB for
  Caltrain's Rust draws (the recorder is the difference); nothing in
  `app.js`.
- **A TypeScript and a Rust source in one app** (LLP 1027.002): the
  TypeScript module is in the page from boot, the Rust module arrives after
  first pixel. Once it is ready it is asked first, and a source it calls
  `UnknownSource` goes to the TypeScript module; until then a source the
  TypeScript module throws on is not ready and is asked again at
  `data.ready`. An app whose web build bakes with no single Rust source
  builds its own `rust.module.package` crate (Update Lab's).
- **Native modules** (LLP 1024): `NativeProps` compiles (`NP`, the JSON
  `stdlib::native_props` writes), and a custom element is the module
  element (`nm`), attached by the wasm host's `native-glue.js`, unchanged,
  in a chunk (`native.js`, 2.0 KB) fetched after first paint, over the
  app's module artifact (`modules/`); a module's event reaches the
  handlers as an `exact-native` event on its element. A TypeScript source
  gets `native` as on the wasm web host: `later` goes to the artifact's
  `later`, `watch` re-asks the answer's resources when the artifact's
  `connect` announces the topic, and the web has no synchronous `call`.
  Found on the way: a store reader's compiled value (the plan's `reader`)
  is the empty store's answer, a placeholder the runner asks past at boot;
  the JS target took it as settled. It asks now (the recorder's status,
  which reads `native.available`, showed "not available"). The runtime pays
  55 B in every `app.js` (the handler check and the agent gate below).

**Delivery on the web.** The web is delivery's origin row (LLP 1030.000):
each publish writes an immutable release and swaps one pointer last, so a
fresh load is current, and an open tab keeps loading its own release's
content-named chunks until it reloads. The web holds no update store and
no stream: `exactDelivery` answers the embedded entry with nothing staged
(L = 0), which is what a bake compiles. So the JS runtime needs no update
client, and a browser needs none of the signed bundle — the envelope, the
baked plan and the production receipt are the native streams' payload.
What the web root must keep is narrower: the same plan the streams
publish, so one release is one program everywhere; the origin files (the
web manifest, install and auth pages, the association file, sitemap and
robots); and the envelope link a native client follows from the page URL
(LLP 1023 D1). The smallest path that keeps all three: `deploy.mjs` keeps
its production wasm bake as the producer of the bundle and the receipts,
and when the JS target takes the app it compiles that bake's baked plan
(`host/web-js/build.mjs --plan <bake>/app.plan --production`: agent mode
refused, as the wasm host's files are gated, LLP 1069.007 D2; the bake's
origin files and head links carried; pages rendered over the release
shell with the manifest's origin) and publishes it as the web root; else
the wasm bake is the root, the refusal printed. The root publishes the
wasm root's allowlist of files plus the JS build's whole tree (its
content-named chunks and rendered pages), each document anchored in its
immutable release, and the runtime resolves a root-named app file
(`/deck/…`, `/assets/…`) in the release, as the web host's
`localAssetURL` does. `smoke.mjs deploy` drives it; a release admits no
agent mode, so the smoke reads the published page as a browser shows it
(the agent's tree and logs were unavailable there since the production
gate, for the wasm root too). When the wasm program retires on the web, the bake stays: what the
streams need from it is the `<app>-web` crate's build script (the baked
plan and its receipt), not `app.wasm`.

**Native clients' live reload.** The JS loop does not serve the native
envelope, by decision. A native client consumes a generation: the plan
plus each executor's native artifact (Hermes bytecode for a TypeScript
source, a native Rust module), which the resident loop's producers make
(LLP 1023, 1027, 1029); the JS loop makes browser artifacts. Serving the
envelope from it would mean running those producers — the resident loop a
second time. A native client opens `dev.mjs --wasm`, and the JS loop's 404
says so. Retiring the wasm web target needs the resident loop's producers
and generation stream without its wasm page (a browser on the JS build,
reloading at each generation); that is in QUEUE.

**Dev reload.** The loop's ~2.2 s an edit was mostly processes that
rebuilt nothing. Now: the Rust data module is built only when Cargo's
dep-info (and the `rerun-if-changed` of the build scripts behind it) says
something it was built from changed (`module.mjs` `fresh`; its generated
crate is rewritten only when it differs), into this checkout's target
(it was `/tmp/e3-mod`, which every checkout shared); the compiler runs as
its built binary on the same test and writes `app.plan` itself (no second
compile); the GPU module is cached likewise; Bun's bundler runs in
process; the dev build renders no pages (`--render none`: a render entry's
crate bakes the plan, so it rebuilt on every Contract edit) and makes no
server bundle; the loop runs the JS build directly, with a 5 ms debounce.
Measured (metrics' dev row, five edits, p50): video player 104 ms (p95
182; was ~2.2 s), a rebuild ~40 ms of it; Caltrain 307 ms (p95 363), a
rebuild 60–150 ms and a first frame that waits for its Rust module, as an
unbaked plan's resources without a compiled value must. The budget row is
100 ms; the rest is the reload itself.

**Arrange, the reorder drag; `frame` and `measure`** (landed 2026-09-29,
measured; brotli):
- **What.** The web host's own `arrangeController` (motion-glue.js,
  unchanged) over the motion piece, whose runner's half gains
  `reorder_drag.rs`'s (`arrange.js`: the six reorder packets, identities, the
  token and the collection's exact geometry checked before any value, the
  source and neighbours held, the source released at the engine's velocity,
  the frame the page rebases by) and the collection's `reorder.rs` and the
  runner's `reorder.rs` (`reorder.js`: a grip's binding, the source row's
  gap certified by measured rows, each wrapper's absolute target sprung by
  the engine, one owner, the list's `reorderdrop` with the keys the
  collection names). `reorder.js` is installed on list.js's collections by
  the motion piece at the first grip, so a list without a grip carries
  none of it; list.js keeps the hooks and gives its internals to it. The
  compiler resolves `reorderFor` to the strict ancestor with that `id` and
  binds the grip (`onReorder`, which names the grip's view, `data-view`, as
  collection-glue.js pins a contact's row by it) and the list's handler
  (`onDrop`). `frame(id)` and `measure(id)` (LLP 1051.000) are the web
  host's own `geometry-glue.js`, fetched after first paint by a plan whose
  actions read geometry (`geo`), answering the runner's `Geometry` record.
- **Found and fixed.** motion-glue reads the drag timelines' custom
  properties from an element's own declaration: static ones are now
  inline, as presence's are (Interaction Gallery's swipe rows and deck
  consumers followed nothing). The JS agent's `layout` left out zero boxes
  the wasm host's reports (an empty text, a closed popover), which made
  Interaction Gallery's and Messages' layouts look different: Messages now
  conforms 5/5 (its swipes included) and joins the async lane.
- **Cost.** `list.js` 7,865 → 8,010 B (the hooks, 145 B, in every app with
  a virtualized list); loaded with a grip: the motion chunk 15,018 →
  18,238 B (`arrange.js`, `reorder.js`); `geometry-glue.js` 976 B loaded.
  Interaction Gallery's `app.js` 23,615 B, Exact Live's 30,161 B.
- **Conformance.** Interaction Gallery 18/18 (a swipe, the deck's card
  thrown, a row reordered, the sheet's height dragged) and Exact Live 11/11
  (a rundown row reordered), and a synthetic `reorder.contract` 5/5. Both
  apps stay out of the async lane: their first photograph's screenshot
  differs by about 4% in some runs (a PNG scaled by `object-fit: cover`,
  rastered differently from run to run, on either target; calling
  `decode()` on every image made it constant rather than rare); Interaction Gallery joined the lane on 2026-09-29, below,
  "Lane stability").

**Press feedback** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli): a node's
`press-scale` showed nothing on the JS target, since the web host's own
`input-glue.js` reads the factor from the element's own `--exact-press`
and the JS target wrote it in the class. It is inline now (as the timeline
and presence rows are), and a plan with press feedback fetches
`input-glue.js` after first paint (`pressFeedback`, 351 B in `app.js`; the
chunk 2,016 B, loaded). Synthetic `press.contract` 8/8: a held button shows
its scale (conform.mjs gains `down` and `up`), one without press-scale
shows none.

### Files and storage (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli)

- **What.** `host/web-js/files.js`, bundled only for a plan with a file
  input, `saveFile`, a document picker or `share`: the runner's rulings
  (`picker.rs`, `save_file.rs`, `file_pickers.rs`, `share.rs` — the
  checks, the refusals into the journal, the agent's holds `pick`,
  `export`, `open-file`, `open-directory`, `save-file` and `share`,
  answered by `tap @t` / `type @t`) over the web host's own
  `picker-glue.js` and `documents-glue.js`, unchanged, fetched on first
  use. A file input's `change` delivers `Picked` records; `showPicker`
  opens the element's own picker inside the press's activation (commands
  run in the press's commit). A TypeScript source gets `storage` (`fs`,
  `sqlite`) over the web host's adapters under its grants and page store
  key; a Rust source's storage requests (ABI tag 5) run through the web
  host's `storage-request.js`, which also reaches a chosen document
  (`doc:/…`). The adapters ship beside the page only where the grants
  name `fs.` or `sqlite.` (a Rust module's, read from the module at
  build).
- **Found on the way.** A file input is `Control` in the agent's tree, as the
  runner's. A TypeScript app whose web build script does more than bake
  it (Messages generates files its TypeScript imports) has the script run
  first (`cargo check` on its web crate), so a clean checkout builds; and
  the TS bake's `../data` watch named a missing directory for an app
  without a data crate, which reran every such app's web build script on
  every build (the wasm target's too).
- **Not carried.** Fieldnotes' `backupNotes` is owned by Rust on the
  wasm target (`RUST_SOURCES`); on the JS target the app has no Rust
  module (`rust.module`), so its TypeScript implementation answers. A
  TypeScript source's `storage.fs` on a `doc:/` path (no app does).
- **Conformance.** Fieldnotes 10/10, Markdown 5/5. Driven with a scratch store (`--storage`): a note saved and
  backed up through SQLite and the file store, the backup exported to the
  driver's path, a file picked and read back; Markdown opens a chosen
  document and shows it.

### Retiring the wasm target on the web (plan, 2026-09-29)

Charlie asked for this once the JS target covers everything (§8's ruling:
"the wasm target on the web retires once the gaps in §7 close"). As of this
writing every app in `apps/` builds JS, and so does Bluesky outside the
repo. The games under `game/games` (Tennis, Beacons and the fixtures, LLP
1046) do not: the JS build neither finds a game's directory nor reads its
materialized manifest, and a game's logic, generated shells and GPU module
are the game runtime's (LLP 1046), which the JS runtime has no half of; the
wasm target is their web build. What retires is the wasm target as something an app author builds, serves or
ships. What stays is internal: the Rust runner compiled to wasm as a test
reference, and the web crate's build script as delivery's producer, until
each has the replacement named below. Nothing that conformance or a native
client depends on is deleted before its replacement runs.

**What users stop seeing.**

| Surface | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| `host/web/build.mjs <app>` | the JS target; wasm with the refusal printed | the JS target only (landed); a refusal is an error naming the gap. A game builds wasm (ruled, §8). `--wasm` has left the usage text; it stays as an internal flag for the rows below |
| `host/web/dev.mjs` | the JS loop; `--wasm` is the resident loop | the JS loop, a refusal shown in the page (landed). A native client's live reload keeps the resident loop's producers (below) without its wasm page |
| `scripts/deploy.mjs` web root | the JS build of the bake's plan (landed) | unchanged |
| `serve.mjs`, the agent's web host, the smoke's app drive, metrics | what the build makes | JS only |

**What stays internal, and what replaces it.**

1. *Conformance's oracle* (`conform.mjs`): the wasm page is the reference
   every JS step is compared to (state, tree, layout, pixels). It stays as
   the internal reference build (`host/web/build.mjs --wasm`, called only by
   `conform.mjs`). A reference without the wasm page is designed below
   (*A conformance reference without the wasm page*); it is not built, and
   the wasm build stays deleted from nothing until it runs in the lane.
2. *Native clients' live reload* (`build.mjs --url`, `/__dev/open`, `exact
   run`): they read the resident loop's envelope and generations, made by
   its producers — the app's `dev` bin (the resident compiler), the
   TypeScript producer (Hermes bytecode) and the Rust module producer —
   none of which is the wasm. Landed: the JS loop forwards a native
   client's requests to the resident loop (order (d)), and that loop, run
   behind the JS page for an app, builds the bake (`--bake`) rather than
   the wasm, with the bake receipt's `binary.sha256` as its program
   identity. A game's resident loop still builds its wasm page.
3. *The parity tools.* `canvasparity` now takes the JS build as the web
   (landed with this plan: the JS agent reports `state.canvas`, whose
   records for every fixture — draws, pending, generation, backing, the
   bitmap's stretch, errors — equal the wasm host's on pages 2 and 3; the
   whole smoke was not run here: its `direct.html` step's headless Chrome
   `--dump-dom` does not return on this machine, on either target).
   `motionparity` waits on animated images held to the agent's clock
   (`image-glue.js`, a §7 gap). The smoke's bare-plan fixtures and router
   sweep swap plans into a running page (`--plan`, `exact.reload`); the JS
   target compiles one plan ahead of time, so they become one JS build per
   fixture plan, as conformance builds its synthetic plans (`--plan`,
   `--data`).
4. *Delivery's bake* (`deploy.mjs`): the streams' bundle and receipts come
   from the `<app>-web` crate's build script (the baked plan, its compat
   receipt, the TypeScript bytecode, the Rust module), which the wasm build
   runs and then compiles to `app.wasm`. The replacement is the build
   script alone (a `cargo check` of the web crate writes the same bake
   outputs, as the JS build now runs Messages' script) with the envelope
   and receipts read from its outputs rather than extracted from
   `app.wasm`. Until then `deploy.mjs` bakes `--wasm` and publishes only
   the JS root.
5. *Metrics `--long`'s web bytes*: the wasm's code by capability (LLP 1047
   D9) is a measure of the retiring target; it is removed with it, and the
   JS target's per-capability bytes (its chunks) take the row.

**Order.** (a) `reorderdrop` lands and the two apps build JS (landed);
games stay on the wasm target (ruled, §8). (b) The build's fallback becomes
an error for everything but a game, and `--wasm` leaves the user-facing
text (landed: `host/web/build.mjs`; the dev loop shows a refusal or a
compile error in the page and builds again at the next edit). (c)
Delivery's bake without the wasm compile (landed: `host/web/build.mjs
--bake`, internal, runs `cargo check` on the web crate — its build script
writes the baked plan, the receipt and a TypeScript module's artifacts, the
receipt's inputs are the same dep-info — and writes the origin files as the
wasm build does, with no `app.wasm`, glue or leaf wasm; `deploy.mjs` bakes
`--bake` for an app and `--wasm` for a game; the JS root carries the files
the envelope names, a TypeScript module's under `module/`, since the
root's `app.js` is its runtime; RealWorld's bake 9 s against the wasm
build's minutes cold). (d) The resident producers beside the JS page
(landed: the JS loop forwards a native client's requests — the envelope,
`/__dev` and its generations, `/__dev/open` — to the resident loop on a
loopback port, `host/web/dev.mjs --wasm --serve-as <port>`, started at the
first such request; the page's own reload stream is `/__dev/page`; an edit
reaches both, the page rebuilt and generation 2 announced. Behind the JS
page the resident loop builds no wasm (landed after: `--bake`; the
Caltrain web crate edited, "rebuilding the bake… rebuilt in 9.1 s", no
`app.wasm` in its dist; a contract edit announces generation 2). (e) The bare-plan fixtures as
per-plan JS builds: `agent.mjs web --plan` on a JS dist builds that plan
(`host/web-js/build.mjs --plan`, over the dist's Rust module) and serves
it, and the share and document-picker fixtures pass that way. The smoke's
fixtures still take the wasm build: on the JS target they need what the
JS agent does not report yet (`layout <node>`'s detail, an iframe's
outline and load state, a host section in `state`, the tree's
accessibility props, gesture and key deliveries), the same gaps that fail
the smoke's Caltrain drive on the JS target (QUEUE). The router sweep
runs on both targets (landed): `navigation.rs`'s
`browser_session_history_on_the_js_target` builds the sweep's corpus plan
as one JS build (`host/web-js/build.mjs --plan`) served as a build tree,
with the same fixture's history journal, and runs every case the JS
target has a seam for; what is not is named and skipped with its reason:
the in-document reboot and the autofocus case's last part, a carried
reload, both `exact.reload`, an in-document plan swap the JS target
(one compiled plan) has no counterpart for. The autofocus case runs up to
there, on the JS runtime's boot autofocus. The focused route teardown runs on the JS target with
the browser's Back in place of the runner's URL event, and found a fifth
fault: Chrome blurs a focused element while removing it, still
connected, so a retired route's editor dispatched its blur (rt.js now
hears a blur after the removal, on a microtask, and drops it for a
node no longer in the document, as glue.js drops a retired view's). `smoke.mjs web`'s `navigation::` filter runs both. The
sweep found and fixed four JS faults: a same-origin link to a declared
route opened a new document instead of navigating in place (LLP 1038
§7; rt.js now follows it in place, and a link that is also a press
target is the press's alone); an iframe `src` or link `href` bound to a
script URL was written (now refused by the navigable-URL policy the
wasm host applies: http, https, mailto, tel); `serveBuildTree` served an
encoded dot segment (`/.exact/%2e%2e/…`, now `webRequestURL`'s refusal);
and the JS agent's `state` had no `navigation` section (now
`navigation.js`'s observation, as the wasm agent reports). `motionparity`
(landed): the JS agent holds animated images to its clock with the web
host's own `image-glue.js`; JS and wasm captures of Motion Gallery at
every parity time agree (105 of 105 crops in the band), conformance's
Motion Gallery is 4/4, and `motionparity` takes the JS build. (f) The
Linux-host state/tree oracle and pinned JS baselines in the lane; then
(g) the wasm web host (`host/web/glue.js`, the web crate's wasm entry,
`stages.mjs`) is deleted from everything but games and conformance's
reference, which it stays for until (f).

### A conformance reference without the wasm page (design, 2026-09-29; its first step built)

What was asked: the Linux host headless (`agent.mjs linux`) as the
reference for state and tree, and the JS results of a green commit, saved,
as the reference for layout and pixels.

*Measured.* The Linux host runs on this Mac (`cargo build --release -p
caltrain-linux`, 83 s warm). Caltrain and every synthetic plan whose web
drive boots, driven as `conform.mjs` drives (boot, the first ten
presses, `clock +60000`), against the wasm page:

- Tree: equal at every step of Caltrain and of clock, document, dst,
  early, locale, press, regions, rows, styles, time and timers.
- Differences, all the host's and not the runner's: the web page's
  location in the route stack (`url` carries `?agent=1&seed=…`, and the
  boot entry's `id` is 1 or 3 on the web, 0 on Linux), which the router
  plan prints into its tree at every step; and Caltrain's deck screen,
  loaded on the web and not on Linux (the web crate's deck loader).
- Not comparable: a plan needing a capability the Caltrain Linux binary
  does not link (the collection plans) and any web-only step (`back`,
  `wheel`, links, a TypeScript module, files).

*Design.* `conform.mjs --reference linux` keeps every step and the JS
side as they are and replaces the wasm session with two references:

1. State and tree from `open({ host: 'linux', app, plan })`, the data
   app's release binary (built once per data app). Compared with the
   route stack's `url` read as the path alone and `id`s renumbered from
   the stack's first; a step whose op the Linux host has no delivery for
   (`back`, `wheel`, a link) takes the pinned JS result below for state
   and tree as well. A plan whose data app's Linux binary does not link
   its capabilities is pinned wholly.
2. Layout and pixels from a pinned JS run: `conform.mjs --pin <commit>`
   at a green commit (strict pass against the wasm page) saves each
   step's layout boxes and screenshot under the lane's cache, keyed by
   the step and the Chrome build; later runs compare to it with the same
   tolerances.

*Why it is not built.* It is sound for the runner's own semantics (state
and tree: no difference in twelve plans). It is not yet sound as the
lane's only reference, for three reasons. The path-only `url` and
renumbered `id`s hide exactly what the router plan checks, the web
location; so routing moves to the router sweep, which now runs on the JS
target (above), and that move should be ruled, not assumed. A pinned
result is a regression check, not a reference: it cannot say a change is
wrong, only that it is a change, and the startup and runtime agents are
changing the JS page's rendering now; each intended change would need a
re-pin that nothing checks against the runner. And the collection plans
and the web-only steps would be held by pins alone. The step before it
that is sound on its own: run the Linux state/tree comparison beside the
wasm one (a second oracle in the same run), so a disagreement between
the two references shows before the wasm page is removed. Order (f)
waits on that and on a ruling that pins may stand for layout and pixels.

*The second reference, built* (2026-09-29): `conform.mjs --linux`, in the
async lane. Beside the wasm page and the JS page, each target also runs on
the Linux host headless (the data app's release binary, which `--build`
builds; the web's viewport, 420×900; the same facts), and after every step
its state and tree are compared with the wasm page's (`linux` failures;
layout and pixels are the Linux host's own and are not compared). The
only normalization is the route stack's browser location, in the route
stack alone: an entry's `url` loses the harness's query parameters
(`agent`, `seed`, `locale`, `timeZone`, `epoch`), entry ids are
renumbered in the order the state lists them (the web runner's boot adopts
the page's history entry and allocates ids in another order: `2, 0, 1`
for three tabs where Linux has `0, 1, 2`), and the stack's `next` id is
dropped. The router plan prints ids and the address into its text, so it
is compared by state only (`// linux: state only (…)` in the plan). The
comparison stops, saying so, at the first step the Linux host has no
delivery for (a drag, pinch, held press, wheel, a list's `into`, the
browser's history), and where an app reaches what only one host has
(`LINUX_APART`: Caltrain's deck iframe; Markdown Stress's editor
selection report; Native Fixture and Photo Editor, native modules;
Messages, whose data sources write to storage on the Linux host where the
page refuses storage in agent mode without `--storage`, a policy
difference in QUEUE). Measured on the lane's 23 apps and 23 synthetic
plans: 157 steps compared on Linux over 14 apps and 23 plans, every one
equal; 9 apps not compared (six have no Linux host, Weatherlight's Linux
crate builds only its render server, two are native modules). What it
does not hold: everything after a gesture, which is most of the list,
reorder, transform and swipe plans; the iframe, editor and module
surfaces; and all layout and pixels. Those are why the wasm page stays
the reference until §8 question 7 is answered.

**The rest of the dynamic rows** (landed 2026-09-29, measured; brotli):
every dynamic style row is now carried (rows.rs). `box-shadow` is one
declaration of the author's text (the compiler gives all four shadow rows
the same expression); `font-family` a table of css.rs's declaration per
stack; `line-clamp` css.rs's legacy clamp, on a non-scrolling block only
(elsewhere skipped with css.rs's reason); `font-variant-numeric` as
authored; backdrop blur `none` or one `blur()`; a dynamic `press-scale`
the feedback's factor and `scale` as its product, on a node whose own
`scale`, `transition` or `animation` does not also compose (refused by
name there); on a pressed node an `animation` plays its rules'
`-exact-press` copies and a `transition` moves `scale` as
`--exact-scale`, as css.rs writes them; an SVG `transform` is restated in
CSS's grammar (rt.js `svgTransform`, kernel `TransformList`); a marker and
any `url(#…)` name their element by its authored id, resolved at run time
from the node as the kernel's `resolve_id` does (the deepest common
ancestor's first; rt.js `Sr`, over `data-exact-id`, written only in a plan
with such a row), again after the commit when the target is built later.
Cost: only where used; `Sr` and `svgTransform` together 710 B in `app.js`.
Synthetic `rowsmore.contract` 9/9 over Interaction Gallery's dist (held
presses on both pressed buttons). Found: a static `id` in a repeated row
is the same DOM id in every instance on the JS target (the template's one
view number), so a static reference there finds the first instance, not
its own; not fixed here.

**Lane stability and Messages Stress** (2026-09-29): conformance screenshots
now draw every `<img>` nearest-neighbour on both pages
(`image-rendering: pixelated`, injected by `conform.mjs` before each capture).
Chrome picks a scaled image's filter at each raster, on its own clock, so the
first photograph (1448 px shown at 388) came out sharper on one page than the
other in about one run in twenty-five. Waiting for `decode()`, two frames and
400 ms did not fix it. With nearest-neighbour, Interaction Gallery passes
every run and joins the async lane. Exact Live does not: its rundown's first
photograph now differs by 6.33% on every run, although both pages give the
image the same box, the same computed styles all the way up and no
transforms. A sub-pixel raster offset that smoothing used to hide is the
likely cause; it is not found yet. Its crew messages carry test ids
(`crew-swipe-<id>`), and `exact-live.steps` swipes one message past the knee
and one short of it; both steps are equal.
Messages Stress's `toggle-windowed` at 100,000 records is the seam's cap, not
the list. Windowed mode asks for the whole history, and the answer is about
23 MB. The wasm page calls its data source in process and gets all of it. The
JS page calls the Rust module over LLP 1029's seam, which refuses any message
over `MAX_MESSAGE` (16 MiB, `MAX_HOST_WORK_BYTES`). `rust-data.js` then keeps
the previous answer (the bounded window's 200 records, or the manual page's
100) and journals "Rust module rejected the call". Native hosts that load a
Rust module through the same seam get the same refusal. Charlie's ruling
(2026-09-29, relayed): the refusal is the resource's failure on every host
that loads Rust modules; the 16 MiB cap stays; the app windows its data.
Landed: a call the seam cannot carry is `DataError::Interface` (logic/src/lib.rs,
for the request, the executor and the reply), and settlement takes it as the
resource's failure, as it takes a failed reply: the commit stands, the value it
had stays, `failed(resource)` is true and the journal says `resource <name>
failed: <why>` (runner/src/runner/settlement.rs; with nothing to keep it still
refuses). A source's own refusal (unknown source, bad arguments, unavailable)
still refuses the commit, on both runners: `rust-data.js` now throws those as a
refusal, where the JS runtime used to take them as failures. Messages Stress asks
for the whole history up to 10,000 records (about 2.3 MB of bodies) and, past
that, its virtualized transcript asks overlapping 200-record windows, as the
bounded mode does (`derive paged`), saying so in its mode line; a failed
history shows `history-failed`. Finding: Contract cannot size an answer, so
the app's threshold is a record count chosen from the bodies' size, not the
seam's bound. The eager mode at 100,000 still asks for all of it and now
fails visibly on the JS page. The wasm page hanging on
`toggle-eager` at 100,000 is the eager mode doing what its label warns
("may block input"): it mounts every row. That is the wasm side and is not
changed here.

**Edits before the runtime** (2026-09-29, from the grid benchmark's "select
at load"): a checkbox ticked before the JS runtime ran was lost twice over.
The capture script queued it as `input` and replayed `input`, but a
checkbox's handler hears `change`; then adoption wrote the state's `false`
over the box. Now the capture script queues `input` and `change` as they
were fired (a text field's repeated `input`s stay one entry; a checkbox's
changes are all kept, since a toggle counts them). The runtime reads what
each edited control shows before its adopting commit, puts that back
afterwards, then replays the events in order. A checkbox's `change` and
`input` carry whether it is checked, and an action that refuses snaps it
back, as glue.js does (the JS runtime passed the text `"on"`). Selects had
the same bug by another path: the render host (host/web/src/document.rs)
wrote no `value` on an `option` and did not mark the select's current option,
so a pick made before the runtime ran named an option's text, which matched
nothing once the runtime gave each option its value. The document now
carries each option's `value` and `selected`, which a reader without
JavaScript sees as well. Contract has no radio input (LLP 1069.001). Cost:
the capture script 1,212 → 1,279 B, inline in every page; `app.js` +298 B
(+95 B brotli). Synthetic `early.contract` is a page rendered at build with
`activate=interaction` (its text field commits on `change`: the render host
makes a page with an `input` handler eager). conform.mjs checks both boxes,
types a word and picks the second option before the runtime runs, then reads
the controls and the state; before the fix the result was `off off  one`.
The JS agent's tree also names controls as the runner does now: a checkbox,
range, date, time or file input, or a select, is a `Control` (a checkbox
reports no `value`), and an option is `Text`.

**The JS agent, and `smoke.mjs web` on the JS target** (2026-09-29): the
Caltrain drive and every bare-plan fixture pass on JS builds (a fixture is
`agent.mjs web --plan` over the app's JS build: a JS build of that plan); the
router sweep keeps its wasm build beside its JS-target sweep (above).
What the JS agent (agent.js) now reports as the wasm agent does:
`layout <node>` — the host's half as glue.js's `nodeDetail` gives it (the
viewport, local and capture spaces, the scroll and clip chains, visibility,
the element, the browser's inherited values) and the rows with their sources;
the JS target keeps no kernel, so an own row is a declaration of the element's
class or inline style (`dynamic` when a binding wrote it), an inherited row
comes from the nearest view declaring it, else `initial`; a stale id is refused
by name. An iframe's `url`, `loading` (its latest src load) and same-origin
guest outline in `tree`, `hit` in `layout`, and taps and typing into its guest
(navigation.js's `guestTap`/`guestType`). `state`'s `navigation` and `media`
sections; every reply tagged with an epoch (a commit is one) and incarnation 1.
The journal's first line is `boot: N nodes, epoch E` ("adopted the document"
follows it), and a clock jump whose timers send nothing is one advance with the
runner's `advance → N timers fired` line (agent mode only: this journal is not
a ring). The tree's accessibility props as element.rs writes them
(`accessibleName` on a pressable, `accessibilityLive`, `accessibilityRole`,
the rest of the aria group, `placeholder`, `viewportFit`, `autofocus`; an
authored `autofocus=false` is kept as `data-autofocus`). Every operation waits
for the after-paint pieces on their way (rt.js `pieces()`, as glue.js waits for
`pieces.pending()`): a press before the motion piece arrived played its spring
at once, and a swipe had no recognizer yet. Found and fixed in the runtime:
the document's `autofocus` never ran (now once at boot, unless the reader
already focused something); a press on a `retainFocus` node took the editor's
focus (the glue's pointerdown rule, now rt.js's); and an iframe's `message`
was heard from any document its guest navigated to (now only from the origin
of the committed src, as glue.js's `guestMessageAuthorized`). Cost: rt.js
+849 B minified (+308 B brotli) before tree shaking; agent.js (agent only)
7.7 → 12.3 KB.

## 8. Rulings and open questions for Charlie

**Rulings.**
- *Pre-rendering* (Charlie, 2026-09-28): "keep both options available to
  allow for different deployment scenarios, but Rust should be the
  primary/default." The Rust render host writes pages by default; the JS
  render (`render.mjs`) is the option.
- *The name and the default* (Charlie, 2026-09-28, relayed): this is exact2's
  web support, not "Exact 3" — a new compile target for the same Contract.
  The web build uses it by default when an app qualifies and otherwise builds
  the wasm target, printing the refusal; a flag forces either. The wasm target
  on the web retires once the gaps in §7 close (they are listed in
  `rules/DEFERRED.md` too). The conformance harness is a required check: it
  runs in the async lane (`conform.mjs --strict`), since RULES keeps the five
  blocking checks under a minute and this run takes minutes and a network.
  Questions 1, 2 and 6 below are answered by this ruling.
- *Games* (Charlie, 2026-09-29, relayed): "Game runtime is fine to be on
  wasm." A game (`game/games`, LLP 1046) builds the wasm target on the web;
  for an app, what the JS target refuses fails the build (§7, "Retiring the
  wasm target on the web", step b).

**Open.**

1. **The name.** Is this Exact 3, or an exact2 web target? Nothing native
   changes, which argues for a target; a second runner is a big enough change
   to argue for a name.
2. **The Rust wasm path.** Does it stay as a fallback, for apps using a
   capability the JavaScript runtime lacks (D5's refusal) and as an oracle in
   the browser? Or is it deleted once the JavaScript runtime covers the apps
   ("delete; don't deprecate")?
3. **DEFERRED.** Admitting a JavaScript runner above the seam is a trade. What
   comes off? A candidate: LLP 1047's remaining core diet and staging lanes
   (D9's report, the data split), which this makes moot on the web.
4. **A byte budget in RULES.** Should the time-budget table gain "First
   interaction, web, Caltrain: ≤ 25 KB brotli", tracked per commit like the
   other rows and never blocking? The spike's number would set it.
5. **The working set** is at 15 of 15, so this document isn't linked into
   `llp/current/`. Should it be, and what leaves?
6. **New apparatus.** The spike adds a backend, a runtime and a runner mode for
   `agent.mjs`, on its branch. Landing any of them on main needs your yes
   under RULES §Agents.
7. **Conformance without the wasm page.** May a JS run saved at a green
   commit stand as the reference for layout and pixels, and may routing be
   held by the router sweep (now on the JS target) rather than compared
   against a runner, so that the Linux host can be the reference for state
   and tree? (§7, "A conformance reference without the wasm page": designed,
   not built; until then the wasm page stays conformance's reference.)
