//! `Later`, runs each turn there against a scoped snapshot — staying on the
//! owner through the source's own continuation waits — and hands the turn's
//! envelope back for the runner to commit (D3). With `Placement::Main` it
//! is the source, inline, and costs nothing. The same proxy serves a Rust
