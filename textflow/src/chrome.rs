//! Chromium's pair table for Latin-1 line breaks.
//! @ref LLP 1043 §4 C — Pretext's corpora showed where the walker and Chrome disagree.
//!
//! Blink decides a break between two characters in U+0021..=U+00FF from a
//! generated table, `kFastLineBreakTable` (Chromium
//! `third_party/blink/renderer/platform/text/character_property_data_generator.cc`,
//! BSD-3-Clause, © The Chromium Authors), before it asks ICU. The rows below are
//! that table as Pretext decoded it (`src/generated/engine-break-data.ts`, MIT,
//! © Pretext contributors), factored into 14 distinct rows and 13 distinct
//! columns; WebKit's table differs from it in 14 of 6,244 bytes.

/// Row class of the character before a break, indexed by `char - 0x21`.
