# Contract: a complete working guide for agents

Use this guide to author, change, inspect, and verify a current Exact application.
It covers the language implemented on `main` on 2026-10-02. Start here for an
implementation task; use the [human guide](contract-for-humans.md) for explanations
and complete examples, and the [grammar reference](contract-grammar.md) for exact
forms, built-in functions, tags, and event payloads.

The compiler and executable fixtures are authoritative. Read the repository's
`AGENTS.md`, `rules/RULES.md`, and `rules/DEFERRED.md` before making changes here.
This guide is documentation, not an additional policy layer. Documents in
`llp/research/` describe a predecessor and do not establish current capabilities.

## Orient and choose the right layer

1. Identify the app, its root `app.contract`, `app.json`, data module, imports,
   authored tests, and requested target hosts. An external app uses `EXACT_APP_DIR`
   with the same exact2 build/driver scripts.
2. Read the nearest working example for the feature. Search `contract/corpus/`,
   `contract/cli/tests/it/`, and the app's sources before designing new syntax.
3. Decide whether the change belongs in Contract, the app's data module, its
   optional native/GPU module, or the host. Do not extend the compiler to avoid
   writing an ordinary data-source function.
4. Check the current branch and dirty files. Preserve other work. Do not commit
   unrelated staged paths or use `git stash` in this repository.

For the implementation, the relevant authorities are:

| Declarations, statements, elements | [`parser.rs`](../contract/syntax/src/parser.rs) |
| Precedence, templates, callbacks | [`parser/expr.rs`](../contract/syntax/src/parser/expr.rs) |
| Records, locals, callbacks | [`types/records.rs`](../contract/types/src/records.rs), [`types/actions.rs`](../contract/types/src/actions.rs), [`types/lists.rs`](../contract/types/src/lists.rs) |

The useful design context is [LLP 1006](../llp/1006-contract-compiler-v1.spec.md),
[1017.000](../llp/1017.000-contract-v1-1.spec.md), and
[1035.005.000](../llp/1035.005.000-contract-after-the-apps.rfc.md).
A proposal in a design document is not an implemented grammar production.

## The implementation loop

Run from the exact2 root unless the app's own wrapper says otherwise:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cargo run -q -p contract -- build apps/caltrain/app.contract --json
cargo run -q -p contract -- symbols apps/caltrain/app.contract
cargo run -q -p contract -- fmt --stdout apps/caltrain/app.contract
bun host/web/dev.mjs --app caltrain
```

Use `build --json` before and after the edit. It returns one JSON array with all
independent diagnostics it can collect, capped at 20; success is `[]`. Keep the
exit status: 0 success, 1 compilation/I/O failure, 2 invalid invocation. Read all
diagnostics, including related locations, before making the next repair.

Formatting is explicit. `fmt --stdout` previews, `fmt --check` checks, and plain
`fmt` writes. Avoid formatting unrelated files. `symbols` reports definitions
and references, with component interfaces and inferred action effects. Search
by exact name with `symbols file.contract --name name`.

After compiling, build and drive the actual app. For Caltrain on the web:

```sh
bun host/web/build.mjs caltrain-web
bun scripts/agent.mjs web tree "tap change-station" "type station-search Palo" state logs
bun scripts/agent.mjs web --test apps/caltrain/app.test.contract
```

For another app, supply its `--app` and build target as its manifest/scripts
require. For an external app, set `EXACT_APP_DIR` on both build and drive. A stale
artifact is a failed verification; rebuild what the driver names. A successful
Cargo rlib build does not prove a native app launches or behaves correctly.

Use the existing five repository checks for repository changes. Do not add a
new global check or fixture framework for an ordinary app edit. For documentation,
compile complete examples, parse authored tests, and check local links.

## Language inventory

| Form | Placement | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `use Name from "./file.contract"` | File | Local import inside the app boundary |
| `shape Name` | File | Finite record with typed fields |
| `fn name(arg: T): U = expr` | File | Effect-free, nonrecursive expression function |
| `style Name` | File | Literal style attributes |
| `keyframes Name` | File | Constant animation frames |
| `font "Family" = "path.ttf"` | File | Bundled family; block form supports faces |
| `routes nav` | Root file | Route table and implicit router state |
| `component Name` | File | Root (first component) or reusable child |
| `test "description"` | Test file, normally | Agent interaction steps; not a plan assertion block |
| `props` / `inject` | Component | Typed interface / inherited bindings |
| `provide` | Component | Whole-view provider bindings, one per line |
| `slot` | Component | Accept caller-authored children |
| `state name = expr` | Component | Stored state |
| `derive name = expr` | Component | Dependency-driven computed value |
| `resource name = source(args) as shape T` | Root component | Reactive data request |
| `mutation name as shape T` | Root component | Optional reply slot for explicit sends |
| `action name(args)` | Component | Event transaction; effects inferred |
| `task name mount` | Root component | One timer/frame schedule |
| `view` | Component | UI tree |

Top-level declarations begin in column 1. Indent with spaces. Comments use `//`.
Use double quotes for strings and backticks for templates. Names admit CSS
hyphens, so write `a - b` for subtraction between identifiers. Units are quoted
(`"12px"`, `"50%"`), not number suffixes. Element attribute continuation lines
are deeper than the element and begin with `name=`. Parentheses permit multiline
calls and expressions without creating an indentation block.

## Values, expressions, and functions

- Types are `number`, `string`, `bool`, declared shapes, `option<T>`, `list<T>`,
  and `action` for behavior interfaces. Do not emit authored `any` or object types.
- `none` and `[]` need an inferable element type. A state initialized by either
  usually gets that information from later assignments; a typed argument or
  the other conditional/match arm can also supply it.
- `Shape(field=value, …)` constructs every field exactly once.
  `Shape(base, field=value, …)` copies a base of the same shape and replaces fields.
  The one positional base comes first. Compiler-owned shapes are not constructible.
- Use field access, arithmetic, comparisons, boolean operators, ternaries, and
  exhaustive option matches. There is no truthiness or optional chaining.
- Inline match is `match x { case some(v) => a, case none => b }`; the comma is
  required and the `some` arm comes first. The block statement/view form has
  separate indented `case` arms.
- `map(xs, (x, i) => expr)` and `filter(xs, x => bool)` return values, not nodes.
  `join(xs, separator)` accepts primitive items. `first(xs)` and `at(xs, i)`
  return options; `at` supports negative indices.
- Standard calls are free functions, not methods: `trim(s)`, `includes(s, q)`.
  There are no nonempty list literals, object literals, general lambdas, array
  indexing, assignment expressions, or JavaScript built-ins by implication.
- `fn` parameters and return types are explicit. Its body is one expression over
  its parameters and standard calls (including `now()`), without component-state
  capture or recursion. Pass an app value in; do not invent an ambient reference.
- Named arguments belong to component uses, record constructors,
  `t("key", placeholder=value)`, `empty(field=value)`, canvas `surface=` bindings,
  and the commands `share(…)` and `scrollIntoView(…)`. Every other function takes
  positional arguments.

For the full roster and special calls, see
[standard functions and intrinsics](contract-grammar.md#standard-functions-and-intrinsics).
For record behavior in a callback, use [records](../contract/corpus/records.contract)
and [the record tests](../contract/cli/tests/it/records.rs).

## State and action semantics

Action reads see the starting state. Writes commit together. They do not provide
imperative read-after-write visibility. Bind intermediate calculations with `let`:

```contract
component App
  state count = 0
  state doubled = 0
  action advance
    let next = count + 1
    count = next
    doubled = next * 2
  view
    button press=advance testId="advance"
      text `${count}/${doubled}` testId="result"
```

The first press yields `1/2`. Writing `doubled = count * 2` instead would use the
old count and yield `1/0`. The same snapshot rule applies inside nested branches
and to locals declared after a state assignment.

A local is immutable, block-scoped, and visible only after its declaration. It
cannot shadow an in-scope name. Two disjoint arms may declare the same local name.
An action can assign only its own writable state/mutation slots, never a prop,
derive, resource value, or arbitrary record field. Replace a record with a copied
record. `send` targets a mutation owned by that component.

Permitted statements: assignment, `let`, `send`, `refresh`, known host command,
`if`/`else`, and option `match`. No loops or general action calls. The compiler
infers effects from the body; `writes` is a refusal, not an optional annotation.
Use `symbols` when you need the inferred write set.

A derive is not mutable storage, an async effect, or a timer. Derive cycles are
refused. Avoid unnecessary state that can be calculated from existing values.

## Composition and lifetime

The first component is the root. Each component use is `Name(prop=value, …)`.
Supply every declared prop exactly once; props have no defaults (pass `none` for
an option). An `action` prop can receive a reference with
captured arguments; the eventual event payload is appended at invocation.

Children may hold state, derives, and actions. They cannot declare resources,
mutations, or tasks. Lift shared data requests to the root and pass values and
actions. A child used under `each` owns row state keyed to that row's identity.
Stable keys matter when content is inserted, removed, filtered, or reordered.

A component `provide` section lists `name = expr` or bare `name` entries. A
descendant declares `inject` with typed fields. The nearest provider in the
component-use chain wins and covers the providing component's whole view.
The old view wrapper `provide name = expr` is refused. Use a small wrapper
component if a subsection needs different values.

`slot` declares a receiving component's one content slot. `children` places the
caller's nodes in its view. The fill keeps its caller's variables and providers,
not the receiving component's provider override. Do not invent named slots or
render-function props.

Imports resolve local `.contract` declarations, with cycle and app-boundary
checks. Paths begin with `./` and cannot contain `..` segments. They do not load app logic or expand the available built-in function
roster. Compiler-owned router names exist only with a `routes` declaration.

## Data requests and side effects

Choose the mechanism from its lifetime:

| Requirement | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Value follows query arguments | `resource result = source(args) as shape T` |
| Explicit command with a reply | `mutation reply as shape T`, then `send reply = source(args)` |
| Re-request current resource arguments | `refresh result` |
| Refresh reads around a mutation | `mutation … refreshes resourceA, resourceB` |
| React once to a settled mutation | `mutation … then actionName` |
| Pending indicator | `pending(resourceOrMutationName)` |
| Resource request failed without an answer | `failed(resourceName)` |
| Initial resource fallback | `else empty(field=constant)`, or `else source(values)` answered once at build |

Resources read as their declared type. Mutations read as `option<T>` and start at
`none`. Do not treat a resource as an optional wrapper unless its declared type
itself is optional. A mutation reply is unwrapped with match.

The current request owns its answer; older replies cannot overwrite a newer
request. Assigning a mutation forgets its in-flight reply. `refreshes` re-reads
its resources when the mutation is sent (an answer the source gives at once shows
immediately) and forces them again when the reply lands. `then` is parameterless,
runs once at the host's next clock advance as a new commit, reads the latest
answer, does not run for a failure that brought no answer, and cannot send its
own mutation. Do not mistake the scheduling boundary
for a general async workflow or a per-reply event log.

A failed resource retains its value or placeholder, with `pending=false` and
`failed=true`. Argument changes, refresh, or successful answers clear the failure.
A domain error returned as a record is an answer and must be handled as data.

Infer the actual source interface from the Contract:

```sh
cargo run -q -p contract -- types path/to/app.contract -o /tmp/app.contract.d.ts
cargo run -q -p contract -- rust path/to/app.contract -o /tmp/shapes.rs
```

Use those generated declarations with the existing TypeScript/Rust integration.
The compiler accepting a source call does not provide its implementation. Check
its arguments, declared result, grants, storage access, and bake-time behavior.
Keep generated output out of version control. Use app-local sources for domain
formatting or algorithms beyond the finite standard roster.

A bake runs initial data work and packages first-frame values. Live requests
run after that under host scheduling. Do not assume a secret store, disk database,
or authenticated network session is available while baking. See
[the data-module reference](reference.md#generate-typescript-data-source-types).

## Views, layout, and interaction

The view forms are element, component use, `when`/`else`, keyed `each`, exhaustive
option `match`, and `children`. Wrap root regions in a stable element. A component
call uses parentheses; a built-in element uses space-separated attributes.
`button "Save" press=save` is text-child sugar; an explicit text child is useful
when that label needs its own styling or driver id.

Use the CSS and HTML vocabulary. Defaults matter: a bare box is block and
content-box, while `row` and `column` supply flex styles. Do not emit React Native
property names, invented CSS aliases, or unknown HTML tags. Read the schema and
tag mapping for admitted properties and units. CSS standard behavior does not
imply that every browser API is implemented on every host.

`class=Style` applies literal style values; node attributes win. Conditional
classes select two named styles with `class=(condition ? A : B)`. Computed values
go on nodes. There is no selector cascade, dynamic style object, or arbitrary
class-string composition. A style branch can mix a number and a CSS keyword in
a property's admitted value space; this does not add general union types.

For scrolling, provide a bound and inspect measured layout. For virtualized
lists, use `list virtualized=true` (no other tag takes it), one direct keyed
`each`, and one flow root per row. A vertical list needs `height`, `max-height`
or a growing `flex`, and takes `estimated-item-height`. A horizontal one needs a
literal `display="flex"` and a literal positive `height`, takes
`estimated-item-width`, and refuses wrapping, reversed or right-to-left flow, a
nonzero `gap`, main-axis padding, `justify-content` other than `flex-start`, and
`reorderdrop`. Lists nest one level deep; an inner vertical list needs a literal
`height` or `max-height`. Do not revive the removed legacy `item-height`
windowing mechanism.

A native button is an explicit `button appearance="auto"` after class merging;
an ordinary button remains an authored `appearance="none"` pressable. The switch
must be literal. Native title/symbol children are face data, not general layout.
A symbol-only face needs a nonempty accessible label. `buttonStyle` is a declared
styleable host-policy prop; its names and allowable branches are checked against
`schema.json`'s `buttonStyles`. Follow the native-button allowlist and context
checks in [`controls.rs`](../contract/lower/src/controls.rs), and test the actual
platform look. Do not assume arbitrary custom paint or typography is admitted.

Keep `id` and `testId` separate:

- `id`: host command target, geometry, cross-node references.
- `testId`: driver/test target and stable inspection name.
- `each` key: data identity for row lifetime, not either node id.

Events bind actions (`press=save`, `input=edit(item.id)`). Captured arguments come
before host payload arguments. Do not add an event object or a JavaScript closure.
`navigate` is special: no captured arguments and zero or one location parameter.
`transformgeometry` and `transformrelease` must be paired. The complete payload
matrix is in [events](contract-grammar.md#events).

Known host commands are statements, not expression-returning functions. Several
commands have specialized argument checks; some generic commands leave validation
to the host. Do not infer that compiler acceptance proves a command's arguments
work. Use the command's working fixture and inspect its host result.

## Routes and web documents

Declare at most one `routes <slot>` in the app's root file. Each row names an
absolute path pattern, optional tab membership, parentage by indentation, and
optional rendering/activation policies. `notfound` is a bare fallback. Do not
redeclare the implicit router state with `state`.

Assign the results of `open`, `push`, `replace`, `go`, `select`, or `back` to that
router state. Use `path("route", args…)` to construct checked locations. A
template literal as a location is refused (`route-template`) and a string literal
is checked against the table, but any other computed string is not checked, so
always build locations with `path()`. A route's parameter fields are strings, with
empty strings for absent fields. `select` takes a tab name, not a URL.

`each entry in stack(nav) key=entry.id` gives retained screens their identities.
Bind the host's navigation root and per-entry `navigationKey`s as the
[router fixture](../contract/corpus/routes.contract) demonstrates. Test back,
tab switching, the same-URL push, external navigation, and route parameters.

A `head` node supplies document metadata. The innermost active value wins for
each field. `scroll document` declares page scrolling. Route `render`/`activate`
policy belongs to the site's renderer/build pipeline; follow
[the document fixture](../contract/corpus/document.contract) and
[LLP 1048.003](../llp/1048.003-documents-in-contract.spec.md). Do not claim SEO,
streaming, or deployment correctness from a client-only screenshot.

## Time, motion, graphics, and platform facts

A root task has one `every(ms, action)`, `after(ms, action)`, or
`every(frame, action)` entry. The action is parameterless. Millisecond intervals
are whole-number literals of at least 1. The frame form has no delta-time argument and does not
catch up missed display frames. For deterministic tests, use the driver's clock.

`now()` is the runner's clock in milliseconds since boot (the driver's clock under
the agent), not a date. For the date, read the reserved `exactTime` source and add
`time.epochAtZero + now()`. A read does not itself schedule a future render. Use a timer if a displayed value must keep changing without other
input. Prefer `clock settle` to waiting for a transition in real time.

Use admitted CSS transitions and keyframes. Check which properties animate and
which require optional capabilities. `spring(…)` (a `transition` timing
function), `exit-animation`, `layout-transition`, and presentation timelines have
specific documented behavior;
they do not admit arbitrary frame callbacks or a second app-state graph.

`frame(id)` and `measure("literal-id")` are action-only geometry reads returning
`Geometry`. Handle `unavailable` and `provisional`. `frame` reads the last layout's untransformed
border box in root space; `measure` reads an auto-height hypothetical layout.
Neither is a computed style binding to run every render.

SVG uses SVG names. `foreignObject` compiles and renders on the web; native hosts
refuse it at run time, so position a box over the `svg` there. Canvas 2D calls
live in a data module, and GPU/game surfaces in their optional module. A
hyphenated native tag must be listed in `app.json`'s `modules` (the bake refuses
others) and implemented by the module; its attributes pass through unchecked. Do not
turn a missing widget or canvas operation into invented Contract syntax.

Platform facts are reserved sources (`exactViewport`, `exactPage`, `exactDelivery`,
`exactSurface`, `exactTime`); the bake refuses a declared field the source does
not have. Use dimensions, media preferences, page facts,
and capability state rather than suffixing files by platform. Preference facts
inform authored policy; the engine does not automatically remove all motion.

Localized strings use `t("key", name=value)` and app `strings/<locale>.json`
files. Compile against the files to check keys and placeholders. Formatting
functions accept a narrow set of literal formats; app wording is an app `fn`.

## Inspection and testing

Build diagnostics include stable ids and original file ranges. Locations are
1-based line/byte-column coordinates, with exclusive end columns; a usage, I/O or
manifest error has no range (line and columns 0). Honor related
locations when an error crosses a child prop, injected action, or imported file.
Do not use a character index as a byte offset in Unicode source.

```sh
cargo run -q -p contract -- build path/to/app.contract --json
cargo run -q -p contract -- symbols path/to/app.contract --name save
cargo run -q -p contract -- build path/to/app.contract -o /tmp/app.plan --map
```

The source map (`<plan>.map.json`, beside the plan) is separate from the plan and
keyed by its digest. Use it only for
the accepted generation it describes. The driver can connect layout to the
original declaration, component call sites, and winning style attribute.
Production artifacts do not need a development source map.

The driver has nine operations: `tree`, `screenshot`, `tap`, `type`, `state`,
`layout`, `logs`, `clock`, and `prefer`. Variations are arguments, not new commands.
Use `tree` to find targets, `state` for data and delivery, `layout` for geometry,
and screenshots for rendered output. Logs name refused operations and data errors.

Authored tests are a smaller language over that API:

```contract-test
test "an action uses its computed next value"
  expect state count == 0
  tap "advance"
  expect text "result" == "1/2"
  expect state doubled == 2
```

This test goes with the complete example above. The steps are `tap "id" [hover]`,
`type "id" "text"` or `type "id" key "Name"`, `clock settle|+ms|ms`,
`screenshot "file"`, `expect tree has|missing "id"`, `expect text "id" == "…"`,
and `expect state name == <number|string|bool|none|[]>`. Not every interactive
driver operation is a test-file statement. `contract test` parses and prints JSON;
`agent.mjs <host> --test <file>` actually drives the app.

Test the behavior being changed: a filter retaining row identity, a text edit
sending the new value, an async error retaining its placeholder, a route back
restoring a screen, or an animation at a specific virtual time. An assertion
that restates a constant is weaker evidence than the user's actual sequence.

## Repair common mistakes

| Refused or misleading form | Accepted direction |
| --- | --- |
| `action save writes item` | Delete the clause; effects come from the body |
| Component `contract` assertions | Authored `test` blocks exercised by the driver |
| `provide theme = value` around view children | Component `provide` section, wrapper component if needed |
| `items.map(...)` / `items[0]` | `map(items, …)` / `first(items)` or `at(items, 0)` |
| `map(items, x => Row(...))` | Keyed `each` with `Row(...)` in its body |
| `[a, b]` / `{ title: value }` | Source/list transform / declared record constructor |
| `{...old, title: value}` | `Shape(old, title=value)`, with the record's declared shape |
| `if name` for a string | `if name != ""` |
| `selected.title` when optional | Exhaustive `match selected` |
| `press={() => save()}` | `press=save` or `press=save(captured)` |
| Calling an action from another action | Put the statements there; factor calculations into `fn` |
| Child `resource`, `mutation`, or `task` | Root-owned declaration and props/injections |
| `fontSize`, `radius`, `resizeMode` | `font-size`, `border-radius`, `object-fit` |
| `width=20px` | `width=20` or `width="20px"` |
| Unbounded `scroll` | Real height/max-height or flex in a bounded layout |
| `state item = none` with no usable type | Supply a typed use/write or rethink whether it is mutable state |
| Read a slot after writing it to get the new value | Compute `let next` before the assignments |
| Dynamic navigation template | `path("route", args…)` |
| Unconditional per-frame app work | CSS/presentation motion where possible; bounded root frame task where needed |
| Add a function because it exists in JavaScript | Check the roster or put the operation in the data module |

Do not “repair” a refusal by adding a compatibility alias to the compiler. A
new language or host feature is a separate, explicit implementation decision.
Repository repair loops are capped at three rounds; report a remaining blocker
with the diagnostic and evidence rather than silently weakening the result.

## Completion criteria

Before reporting an app change done:

- The intended Contract and imported files compile; required data sources exist.
- Complete examples use current syntax, including inferred effects and provider sections.
- The app was built for every affected runtime surface required by repository policy.
- The requested interaction was driven, with state/log/layout evidence as appropriate.
- Authored tests and relevant checks pass, or remaining failures are named accurately.
- Formatting and line caps hold; no generated artifacts or unrelated work entered the commit.
- The result states what changed, how it was verified, and any actual platform limitation.

For learning, continue with the [human guide](contract-for-humans.md). For exact
syntax and vocabulary, use the [grammar reference](contract-grammar.md). For a
new feature, start from the corresponding compiler fixture rather than memory
of JavaScript, React Native, or the predecessor's Contract language.
