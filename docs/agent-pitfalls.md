# Pitfalls when writing exact2 apps

**Adding an entry:** only a pitfall you hit and reproduced on current `main`, written
as symptom → cause → what to do, with where it was found. Delete the entry in the
change that fixes the footgun, or that makes the compiler, runtime or driver
diagnose it. **Candidate diagnostic** marks one that could become a check cheaply.

Read [the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md) first. This list holds what that
guide's rules don't make obvious.

## Layout

- **A root with `min-height="100%"` and `overflow-y="auto"` does not scroll itself.**
  `min-height` lets the box grow with its in-flow content (CSS), so it has nothing to
  scroll and the document scrolls instead: on the web a screenshot shows only the first
  screen, and on iOS a builder found the results stuck below the keyboard (a finger can
  be caught by the root's own scroll view, which has no range). Fix: `height="100%"`
  with `overflow-y="auto"`, or a `column height="100%"` holding a `scroll` with `flex=1
  min-height=0`. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, r33 t1-tip and ios25 t1-tip, 2026-10-06.)

- **A heading's lines are a screen apart with `line-height=28`.** Cause: a bare
  number is CSS's unitless `line-height`, a multiple of the font size (at 22 px,
  28 × 22 = 616 px), unlike a bare number on a length row such as `font-size` or
  `width`, which means pixels. Fix: write `line-height="28px"`, or a ratio such as
  `line-height=1.3` (28.6 px at 22 px). (Authoring bench,
  LLP 1087: three Codex builders, caught only by a screenshot, 2026-10-05.)

- **An image tile grows to its picture's size.** An album tile in a flex row became
  900×1200 pt. Cause: a flex item's automatic minimum is its content size (CSS), and
  an image's content size is its intrinsic size. Fix: give the image or its flex
  parent `min-height=0` (`min-width=0` across a row), or position it absolutely in
  a sized box. (Signal Clone DIARY, build 7.)
- **A sized `symbol:` image is stretched.** An ellipsis became three tall bars.
  Cause: `object-fit` defaults to `fill`, as for `<img>`. Fix: add
  `object-fit="contain"` to every symbol with a `width`/`height`. (Signal Clone,
  2026-10-02.)
- **On iOS the whole window scrolls when the keyboard opens, and the header goes
  with it.** Cause: without `interactive-widget`, the root is not resized for the
  keyboard. Fix: `interactive-widget="resizes-content"` on the root, or
  `overlays-content` with a `role="toolbar" toolbarPlacement="keyboard"` for a
  toolbar that rides the keyboard without relayout (LLP 1008 §9.1). (Signal Clone.)

- **The app is wider than the window, and its tests still pass.** A root with
  `width="100%"` and `padding=24` is 48 points too wide: sizes are `content-box`, as
  on the web, so padding adds to the width. Buttons at the right edge are cut off,
  and an `expect` never sees it. Fix: `box-sizing="border-box"` on any box sized in
  percent that also has padding or a border (`exact new`'s template does), and
  `min-width=0` on a `flex=1` input in a row. Look at a screenshot on each host.
  (Fresh-agent README trial, 2026-10-04.)

- **A raised `z-index` leaves a dragged card under the next column.** A card at
  `position="relative" z-index=10`, dragged over a neighbouring column, paints
  beneath it. Cause: `z-index` orders siblings, not a whole stacking context as in
  CSS (a declared deviation, [LLP 1001](../llp/1001-kernel-v1.spec.md) "`z-index`
  orders siblings"), and on the web a box that follows a positioned or stacked box
  becomes a paint group (`isolation: isolate`). A child cannot rise above its
  parent's later siblings. Fix: raise the ancestor that is a sibling of the others
  (the card's column, while it holds the dragged card), or draw the dragged card in
  an overlay at the board level. For cards between lists, a `reorderGroup` on the
  lists has the host draw the card in its top layer instead ([LLP
  1094](../llp/1094-dropping-across-lists.rfc.md)). (Authoring bench, LLP 1087,
  t4-kanban: two builders, 5 and 10 minutes, 2026-10-04.) A chess board's drag ghost
  is the same: a ghost inside the square it left stays under the squares after it;
  draw it as a later sibling of the squares, positioned in the board (chess diary #5).

- **The content of an overlay vanishes behind its own background.** Cause: a
  background box with `position="absolute"` (a dimmer, a gradient) paints
  over every later sibling that is not positioned, as CSS orders it. Before
  LLP 1083.000 the Apple hosts painted in tree order and hid this. Fix: give
  the content `position="relative"`, or give the background `z-index=-1`
  inside a parent that stacks. (Signal Clone's call screen, build 16.)

- **`flex=0` collapses a column that has a `width`.** A side column written
  `width=400 flex=0 min-width=0` in a 1,100 px row laid out 0 px wide, and the
  pane beside it covered its search field. Cause: `flex: 0` is CSS's `0 1 0%`:
  the basis is `0%`, not the width, and the item shrinks (`flex=<n>` is always
  `<n> 1 0%`; `contract vocab flex`). Fix: `flex="none"` (`0 0 auto`: the width
  is the size), or no `flex` and `flex-shrink=0`. (Stocks DIARY, about 15
  minutes; reproduced on the web and macOS, 2026-10-04.)

- **A `width="100%"` box with padding runs past its parent.** A full-width column
  with `padding=16` measured 1,232 px in a 1,200 px window; an inbox row's time
  painted off the right edge of a phone. Cause: a box is `box-sizing: content-box`,
  as in CSS without a reset, so padding and border add to `width` (and to
  `height="100%"`). Fix: `box-sizing="border-box"` on the padded box or its style;
  or drop `width`, since a box in a block or a `column` already fills the width.
  (Chat2 and Workout DIARY, Gallery's `height`; reproduced on the web, 2026-10-04.)
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler could name `box-sizing` when a
  content-box node has `width="100%"` and horizontal padding.

## Lists and scrolling

- **A tap that changes one row of a long list takes ~80 ms on the web.** Cause: the
  mutation answers the whole list (10,000 rows), and on the JS target a Rust
  module's answer crosses into JS as a copy and every row is checked again. Fix:
  make the list's resource a window (LLP 1027.004: `feed(cursor)` answering at most
  200 rows, `reachstart`/`reachend` on the `list` moving the cursor) and give the
  mutation `refreshes feed`: 16–24 ms. A development build on the JS target says so
  in `logs` (`big answer: <resource or mutation> … carries N list rows`) once an
  answer's longest list passes 2,000 rows (`host/web-js/seam.js`). (Heavy-list
  bench against Dioxus, 2026-10-03.)
- **A bounded list hitches at its first window shift, or its first tap is slow.**
  Cause: a Rust data source that parses or builds its data on first use does it
  then; the first window is baked into the plan, so the first query is the first
  `reachend` (or tap), on the main thread mid-scroll (75 ms for a 7 MB JSON on the
  web). Fix: do that work in `DataSource::activate`, which runs after first pixel.
  (Heavy-list bench, 2026-10-04.)
- **A transcript or feed should open at its newest row.** Writing `scrollTop` to a
  huge number lands short on a virtualized list by the estimate error of the rows
  it has not built (84 pt with `estimated-item-height=52`). Fix:
  `scroll-start="end"` on the `list` (LLP 1010 §6.5), not a `scrollTop` write or a
  `scrollIntoView` after the first command. (Signal Clone, build 4.)
- **The app works hard at rest.** Cause: it commits state that shows on a timer
  (a clock's text written every 250 ms), so every tick changes a view and the host
  runs its whole post-apply pass (navigation, controls, menus, every scroller's
  position) four times a second; before `32805146` this also cut the reader's
  scrolling. A timer's or a scroll handler's commit whose writes show nowhere
  skips that pass; any other still runs it. Fix: write state
  only when it changes (a minute-resolution clock; poll fast only while something
  is in flight: `task poll when inFlight every(200, tick)`), and remove
  `scroll=` handlers left over from experiments: each runs an action per scroll
  frame. (Signal Clone, build 2.)
- **A gate reads state at commits.** A gated task (`task hide when toast != ""
  key=toastUntil`) is armed or dropped by the commit that changes its gate or
  key, never as the clock moves: so a gate cannot read `now()` (refused), and the
  `after`'s action runs at its deadline exactly, `now()` equal to it. An action
  that re-tests `now() > toastUntil` there does nothing and the toast stays up
  forever; clear it unconditionally. (LLP 1092 D8; ledger2 #1, chat F7.)

- **A custom row in a grouped list overflows its card on the right.** Cause:
  the sheet already gives each row its margin (16 pt, or 56 pt after an icon)
  and a 16-pt trailing padding. A custom row with `width="100%"` adds the
  margin on top and runs 16 pt past the card. Fix: leave custom row content
  at its natural width (`flex-grow=1` on the part that should stretch), not
  `width="100%"`. (Signal Clone, build 15.)

- **A data answer past 16 MiB fails only on the JS target.** A 64 MiB string from
  a Rust source loaded on the wasm web host and on Linux, and on the JS target
  the resource failed (`Rust module rejected the call`). Cause: the JS target's
  Rust data seam carries at most `MAX_HOST_WORK_BYTES` (16 MiB) a message; the
  runner's own data source has no such cap. Keep an answer under 16 MiB, or page
  it. (LLP 1090 conformance plan, `host/web-js/conformance/budget.contract`.)

- **A finger on a card's ellipsis title does not lift the card on the web.** A `text`
  inside a `reorderFor` grip with `overflow-x="hidden"` (which `text-overflow="ellipsis"`
  needs) is a scroll container, and `touch-action` is resolved from the touched element
  up to its nearest scroll container (Pointer Events), so the grip's `none` is never
  consulted: where the page can scroll the browser takes a touch that starts on the
  title, and nothing lifts or is logged. A mouse, or a finger on the grip's
  padding, works. Driven at phone size on the web: the card stays; without the overflow,
  or with `touch-action="none"` (or `pointer-events="none"`) on the title, it moves. Fix:
  put `touch-action="none"` on that text too. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, r32 and r33
  t4-kanban, 2026-10-06.)

- **A second card drag right after a drop does nothing.** A drag that starts before
  the last one's session ends is refused (LLP 1094 D8): the drop is held until its move
  shows (a second at most; [the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md#views-layout-and-interaction),
  boards), then the card lands (about 250 ms on the web). No diagnostic names the
  refusal, and the agent's `drag to` reply reads like a success. A board whose drop
  sends a mutation that `refreshes` its cards holds until storage answers, so a quick
  second drag is easy to lose (a person's, or a test's: two `drag to` steps in a row).
  Fix: in a test or drive put `clock settle` between drags; it is needed even when the
  move shows at once, since the landing still holds the session. Showing the move in
  the drop's own commit (the board in state the action writes, saved through the
  mutation) only removes the wait for storage, which shortens what a person meets. (Authoring bench, LLP
  1087, r26 and r29 t4-kanban, 2026-10-05.)

## Native presentation and navigation (iOS)

- **Edge-swipe back does nothing.** Cause: the pop gesture presses the control named
  by the root's `navigationBack`; with no such enabled control in the active route
  it is refused (the log says "back gesture refused"). Fix: `navigationBack="back"`
  on the root and an `id="back"` button on every pushed screen (LLP 1038 §6).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler could warn on a stacked route with no
  control of that id.
- **A pushed screen's content is cut off and never scrolls, or its large title never
  collapses.** Cause: a route is a box, not a scroller, and `navigationScroll` only
  names one; a title collapses only with the scroller right after the route's
  `header`. Fix: a `scroll id="feed" flex=1 min-height=0` right after the `header`
  and `navigationScroll="feed"` on the route (docs/contract-for-agents.md, "Routes and
  web documents"). The compiler refuses a name nothing in the route carries, or one
  on a box that never scrolls (`lower-route-scroll`). **Candidate diagnostics:** the
  compiler could refuse a named scroller that is not right after the `header` (an
  iOS-only rule today, so not refused); the hosts could journal a route whose
  content overflows with nothing to scroll it (QUEUE.md).
- **A sheet won't swipe down to dismiss.** It springs back (the log says "modal
  dismissal refused: no enabled navigationBack control in the active route").
  Cause: as for edge-swipe back, the swipe presses the control named by the root's
  `navigationBack`, and a `navigationPresentation="modal"` route with no enabled
  control of that id refuses it; `closedby="none"` refuses it too. Fix: an
  `id="back"` button (Cancel, Done) in every sheet (`ModalIOS.swift`,
  `refusesDismissal`). (Exact-new iOS app feedback, 2026-10-04.)
- **The app looks like an imitation of iOS.** Cause: controls built from boxes
  (a painted switch, buttons laid out as a tab bar or a title bar, rows drawn as a
  grouped list). Fix: the native Contract forms
  ([the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md#views-layout-and-interaction), "Prefer
  native controls"); a hand-built lookalike of a system control is a bug. Match a
  reference's structure and controls, not its pixels. (Exact-new iOS app feedback,
  2026-10-04.)
- **The agent's screenshots and tree don't show the native bars.** Under
  `scripts/agent.mjs` the navigation bar, tab bar, `UIMenu`s and header search are
  not presented; the authored header, tablist and popover paint instead, by default.
  To see the bars, the tab bar and sheets as a person does, drive with `--chrome
  platform` and take `screenshot out.png window`; menus stay the agent's popovers
  there. (Signal Clone, builds 5 and 10; Splitter, rough 4 and 11.)
- **An overlay's backdrop stops at the navigation or tab bar.** Cause: content
  inside a route draws under the native bars. Fix: render full-screen overlays
  (menus, action sheets) as root children after the tab container, or as a
  `navigationPresentation="fullscreen"` route. (Signal Clone, build 10.)
- **A link in the app's own scheme never matches.** `signalclone://connect?x=1`
  reaches the root's `navigate` handler as the location `/connect?x=1`: the scheme
  is dropped and the host becomes the first path segment (`location_of`, LLP 1038
  D8). Fix: match on the path (`startsWith(location, "/connect?")`), not the URL.
  (Signal Clone, phone path.)
- **VoiceOver reads the screen behind a full-screen overlay.** A call screen
  or menu drawn as a root child above the bars hides the chat list from sight,
  not from VoiceOver: it still reached the rows and the native tab bar behind.
  Fix: `role="dialog" aria-modal=true` on the overlay's root (LLP 1080.003); on
  iOS its siblings, the tab container and its bars among them, are then skipped
  while it shows. (Signal Clone, build 13.) Not `role="alertdialog"` on content
  you lay out: see the next entry.
- **`role="alertdialog"` refuses a dialog laid out in a `column`.**
  `lower-alertdialog: … a `column` row is not text, an action or the cancel`.
  Cause: an `alertdialog` popover or `dialog` is a native confirmation (LLP
  1021: iOS's sheet, macOS's menu), whose rows can only be text, buttons that
  close it, and one cancel. Fix: give a modal you lay out yourself `role="dialog"
  aria-modal=true`; keep `alertdialog` for a flat list of text and buttons.
  (x2apps onboarding's Delete account?, 2026-10-04.)
- **`tabIndex` on a module tag is refused.** `` `paint-surface` has no attribute
  `tabIndex`; `tabIndex` is spelled `tabindex` here ``. Cause: HTML's
  `tabindex` is now an attribute on every element and module tag's box (LLP
  1088 D7.3), with no DOM-property alias. Fix: write `tabindex` (x2apps paint,
  2026-10-04).
- **With `viewport-fit="cover"`, route content goes under the native bar.** Cause:
  the bar's cover is added to the route's padding, but a cover-fit root has no top
  safe area. Fix: put `env(safe-area-inset-top)` on the route column, not on each
  authored header. (Signal Clone, build 5.)

- **After a relaunch on iOS, a form opens with old values and ignores the fresh answer.**
  While the data module is not ready, a native host (and the wasm web target) can make
  the form's child from the resource's kept answer: a device-state reader's last small
  answer for the same arguments. A child's states start once, so the fresh answer does
  not reset them, and a write the resource did not hear about leaves that kept answer
  old. The default web JS target keeps none, so a web run never shows it. Fixes: [the
  agent guide](contract-for-agents.md#composition-and-lifetime), the form that edits a
  saved record (refresh the resource after each write, or key the child by a string or
  number from the answer). (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, ios19, ios22 and ios32
  t7-wizard, 2026-10-05/06.)

- **An empty date input can still show a date on iOS.** `input type="date" value=""`
  draws a date in the `UIDatePicker`, which has no empty state: today in a new picker,
  the last date in one whose value was cleared (`time` and `datetime-local` share the
  picker), while the bound value, `state` and `tree` stay `""` until the person picks. Fix: when the value is empty,
  show the field's emptiness yourself (a "Not set" label beside it), and validate
  the bound value, not the screenshot. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, ios20 t7-wizard,
  2026-10-05.)

## Actions

- **A token kept in an app data file.** Exact has a secret store, and it holds
  strings, not only keys: grant `secret.keep <name>` and use
  `store.set`/`store.get`/`store.forget` in an answer (the Keychain on Apple,
  `localStorage` on the web; a Linux launch forgets it at exit for now). The
  Signal clone kept its signal-cli bearer token in a plain config file because
  `secret.keep` read like the P-256 key store of LLP 1069.005. (2026-10-06.)

- **A superseded send's fetch rejects natively and completes on the web
  build.** A newer `send x = command(…)` replaces the pending one; natively
  (and in the web's wasm module realm) its `await fetch(…)` then rejects with
  a `FetchError` of kind `Aborted` though the request may have been sent,
  while on the web build (the JS target) the reply arrives and is dropped. Clear a busy flag or lock in a `finally`, and don't retry on
  `Aborted` (it would send twice); declare the mutation `queue` when every
  send's reply matters (LLP 1092). Until 2026-10-05 the continuation vanished
  natively, which held the Signal clone's sends forever (build 35).

- **`Date.now()` in a data module passes its Bun tests and fails on the
  device.** Since 2026-10-05 the build refuses a direct use by file and line
  (`Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, timers); an alias still gets
  past the build and throws on first use on every host but Bun. Take the time
  from the call's arguments (the Contract's `wallTime.epochAtZero + now()`), as
  every source already receives it. (Signal clone build 34, 2026-10-05.)

- **A helper action does not see what its caller just assigned.** `sel = next`
  then `follow()`, with `follow` reading `sel`, would read the old `sel`: a call
  is its callee's statements in the caller's one commit, and every statement
  reads the state the action started with (LLP 1089 D2). The compiler refuses the
  read (`analyze-call-stale-read`), naming both lines. Fix: pass the value the
  helper should see, `follow(next)`, or a `let` bound before the assignment for
  the old one. (Spreadsheet F21 and Files F27 diaries, where a copied block was
  the workaround.)

- **A delete or save is lost when the page reloads right after it.** An action that
  `send`s a write and navigates away in the same commit passes every test, but a
  browser reload in the next ~100 ms comes back without the write. Cause: the write
  is the data module's, and it is done only when its mutation answers; the reload
  ends the page first. Fix: navigate in the mutation's `then`, which runs once the
  write has answered. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, a2-contacts and t2-todo, 2026-10-05.)

- **Repeating with `pause` mutations.** A `then` cannot send its own mutation
  (`analyze-then-self-send`), and two mutations whose `then`s send each other
  are the same loop. To repeat while a condition holds, use a task with `when`
  and `every`. See "Repeating while a condition holds" in the guide.

## Sound

- **A scheduled sound plays after Stop.** A sequencer that schedules each step
  ahead (`playSounds(…)` with a future `at=`) keeps sounding the hits already
  scheduled for a beat after the Stop press. Cause: a voice is the runner's once
  its commit stands; a state change does not unschedule it. Fix: call
  `stopSounds()` (or `stopSounds(group=…)`) in the stop action: it stops what
  sounds and cancels what waits (`by cancelled`). (Drums adoption, LLP 1096 D13.)
- **The first sound on the web is silent.** A sound a page plays on load, or
  from a timer before anyone has pressed anything, is dropped and journaled
  `sound blocked: the page has had no user activation`. Cause: browsers start
  audio only after a user activation. Fix: start sound from a press (its own
  commit plays), or accept that a timer's sounds begin after the first tap or
  key. Native hosts have no such rule. (Trivia F5; LLP 1096 D7.)
- **A sequence's first hit is late when the first timer tick plays it.** A
  gated or new `every(25, tick)` first fires 25 ms after it starts, so a downbeat
  left to the tick is 25 ms late. Fix: schedule the first window from the press
  itself (`playSounds(hitsBetween(song, now(), now() + 100))` in the start
  action), then each tick the next (`[scheduledTo, now() + 100)`). (Drums; LLP
  1096 D3.)

## Media session

- **A remote pause leaves a bound `paused` false.** The lock screen's or a media
  key's pause pauses the element; an app that binds `paused` and does not mirror
  the element's `pause` event still holds `paused = false`, so its play button
  and its next commit disagree with the player. Fix: `pause=hostPaused
  playing=hostPlaying`, each setting `paused`. (LLP 1098 D3.)
- **The lock screen's skip is not your action's.** The lock screen shows
  `seekbackwardOffset`/`seekforwardOffset` (default 10), not the number in
  `seekforward=skip(30)`. Fix: keep the two equal, or take the record and seek
  by `d.seekOffset`. (LLP 1098 D2.)
- **On iOS a media session needs a playback session and background audio.**
  `build.mjs --ios` refuses a `metadata=` without `"audio_session": "playback"`
  and `"audio"` in `host.ios.backgroundModes`: the lock screen shows only a
  playback session's media, and audio stops at the lock without the mode. (LLP
  1098 D8.)

## Input

- **A hold's `pointerup` never arrives.** Cause: the press started on a node that a
  state change replaced during the hold; the up is not delivered to a node that no
  longer exists (declared in LLP 1005). Fix: keep the pressed node across the state
  change (change its contents, not which branch renders it).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the runtime could log a dropped up in development.
- **A `transformDragFor` handle does nothing.** No pinch or drag follows and
  nothing is logged. Cause: the binding resolves only for a strict shape and
  otherwise returns none silently (`kernel/src/transform.rs`; only the agent's
  transform-drag command reports "no photo binding"). The target, the handle's one
  ancestor with that `id`, needs
  `width="100%" height="100%" box-sizing="border-box"`, no padding, border,
  margin or offsets, and its direct parent needs `overflow="hidden"` on both axes
  and no padding or border; every other ancestor must be untransformed. (Signal
  Clone, build 11: the photo viewer lacked `overflow="hidden"` and
  `box-sizing`.) **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler or a development log
  could name the failed condition.

- **A text field shows an edit its action refused or normalized.** A field bound with
  `value=text input=edit`, where `edit` ignores a blank value, shows the blank while
  `text` keeps the old value, and the next keystroke builds on what is shown; so does
  one whose action or source normalizes `-2` to the `0` it already held. Cause: on
  the web (both targets) a text field is re-set only when what its binding reads
  changes, so an unchanged binding does not overwrite the edit. Fix: bind the field to draft state that `edit` always writes, and on commit
  (`change`, Enter, `blur`) write the accepted value or reset the draft to it, which
  changes the bound value and redraws the field. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, t2-todo:
  two builders, about 10 minutes each, 2026-10-04; t1-tip, a normalized count,
  2026-10-05.)

- **A checkbox bound to a resource field does not tick until the save answers.** With
  `checked=form.terms change=editTerms`, where `editTerms` sends a mutation that
  `refreshes form`, a click shows the box unchecked again while the save's answer is
  out and checked only when the refreshed answer lands, so a slow store shows no tick,
  and a test that clicks and reads `checked` before the answer fails. Cause: every host (both web targets, iOS,
  macOS) re-sets the box to its binding, `form.terms`, which is still `false` until
  the answer. Fix: bind it to state the action writes at once (`terms = value`, then
  `send`), and seed that state from the saved record as a form does. (Authoring bench,
  LLP 1087, codex17 t7-wizard, 2026-10-05.)

- **`autofocus` on a field an action shows does not focus it on the web.** The JS
  target honours `autofocus` once, at boot; a field mounted later by an action keeps
  the focus where it was (the pressed button). Fix: give the field an `id` and call
  `focus("field")` (the `id`, not the `testId`) in the action that shows it. (LLP 1035.000 D9 says a node mounted later may autofocus, as
  the wasm target does; the JS target's gap is in QUEUE.md.) (Authoring bench, LLP
  1087, r27 t2-todo, 2026-10-05.)

- **A test `drag` is a touch unless `mouse` is set.** `tap "chart" drag 20 0`
  is a finger (`pointerType` `touch`) on the web, so a `pointerup` that treats
  a touch as the finger leaving clears the hover the next assertion still wants.
  Fix: on touch-up, end the drag and leave the hover, or write `mouse` for the
  left button. iOS refuses `mouse`; macOS and Linux drag with the mouse anyway
  ([authored tests](contract-grammar.md#authored-tests)). (Stocks diary: the chart
  readout unmounted, about 10 minutes, 2026-10-04.)

- **A `pan` hears nothing from a finger on the web.** A drag with
  `tap <id> drag dx dy` (or a real touch) moves nothing and logs nothing. Cause:
  without `touch-action="none"` on the pan's box the browser takes the touch for
  scrolling and the pointer events are cancelled. Fix: `touch-action="none"` on the
  dragged box (only that box, so the page still scrolls from elsewhere). (Authoring
  bench, LLP 1087, t4-kanban: about 15 minutes, 2026-10-04.) **Candidate
  diagnostic:** the compiler could warn on a `pan` without `touch-action`.

- **There is no `swipeleft` for swipe-to-delete.** A row built from `pan`,
  `panrelease` and `translate` reveals its Delete button, but by hand on every host.
  Cause: `swiperight` is the reply gesture (a message bubble), not a direction pair;
  the row whose leading or trailing actions a swipe reveals is a horizontal `scroll`
  with `scroll-snap-type="x mandatory"`, its content and action buttons as snap
  children, naming them with `swipeContent`, `swipeLeading` and `swipeTrailing` ids,
  which the web scrolls and iOS turns into UIKit's own swipe actions. Fix: copy
  `apps/messages/app.contract`'s inbox row (`thread-swipe-…`). (Ledger2 DIARY, "Needed:
  swipe gesture", about 15 minutes, 2026-10-04.) iOS refuses a row whose content is
  not exactly the scroll's size, and `logs` says which rule failed (`swipeContent on
  #243 is refused: swipeContent "row" is 390x68, not the row's 390x68.5 border box`):
  a border on the scroll itself shrinks it, so put a hairline on the content (Splitter
  DIARY, rough 10).

- **A `swiperight` hears nothing from a finger on iOS.** A mouse drag fires it on
  the web and macOS, in a drive and in a test, while a real touch on an iPhone
  does nothing. Cause: with `touch-action` at `auto` a horizontal pan is the
  platform's, as in a browser, so the swipe never begins. Fix:
  `touch-action="pan-y"` on the swiped node, which leaves vertical scrolling to the
  page. Messages also gives the bubble `transition="translate spring(300, 30, 1)"`,
  which moves it with the finger; that does not arm the gesture. (Chat2 DIARY,
  which credited the transition, about 20 minutes; reproduced with `agent ios
  --touch platform`, 2026-10-04.) **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler could
  warn on a `swiperight` without `touch-action`, as on a `pan`.

- **A dragged piece snaps back, lands on the wrong square, or a tap moves it.** A
  board has no drop target; build the drag from the pointer events (Chess DIARY,
  about 30 minutes; this recipe driven on the web and macOS, 2026-10-04):
  - Each square takes `pointerdown`, `pointermove`, `pointerup` and
    `touch-action="none"` (a finger otherwise scrolls and the events are cancelled).
  - The square that took the `pointerdown` holds the pointer: its `pointermove`s and
    its `pointerup` come wherever the pointer goes, with `offsetX`/`offsetY` measured
    from that square. The drop square is the held one's column plus
    `floor(e.offsetX / cell)`, and its row plus `floor(e.offsetY / cell)`.
  - Start a drag only past a threshold (`dx * dx + dy * dy > 64`), so a tap stays a tap.
  - Draw the ghost as a later sibling of the squares inside a `position="relative"`
    board (`position="absolute"`, `pointer-events="none"`): `z-index` orders siblings
    only, so a ghost inside a square cannot float over the next one.
  - Keep the piece in its square while it is dragged, dimmed with `opacity`.

  ```text
  action down(i: number, e: PointerEvent)
    from = i
    dragging = false
  action move(i: number, e: PointerEvent)
    if from >= 0
      dx = e.offsetX - half
      dy = e.offsetY - half
      dragging = dragging or dx * dx + dy * dy > 64
  action up(i: number, e: PointerEvent)
    if dragging
      drop(from, from + floor(e.offsetX / cell))
    from = -1
    dragging = false
  ```
- **A write left running after a source answers can be lost on iOS or macOS.** The
  web kept it; the native host did not, and a list was empty after a relaunch. Cause:
  the native data executor runs a source's promises while a request waits on them,
  one request at a time, so a `promise` started and not awaited (a fire-and-forget
  SQLite write) can stay unfinished, and an answer queues behind a request still in
  flight. Fix: await the write before answering, or carry it in a
  request of its own that the view sends (a `flush` source called with the change).
  (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, t2-todo on iOS: about 20 minutes, 2026-10-05.)

- **A control appears a moment after the first frame and pushes the card below
  it down.** Lexy's climate switch was `when climate.ok or loading`, with
  `loading = pending(read)`: `pending()` is false before the first ask, so the
  first frame had neither. Cause: layout gated on load state. Fix: render the
  control from the first frame and say the state with `disabled` (off until the
  value arrives), so the box never changes size. (Lexy on an iPhone,
  2026-10-05.)

## Driving and testing

- **A test passes on the web and fails on iOS right after an input that saves.** An
  `expect` straight after `type` or `tap` reads what the input's mutation answered,
  but an input step only finishes the `then`s of answers already settled; it does not
  wait for outstanding storage ([authored tests](contract-grammar.md#authored-tests)).
  A fast web reply (the web input waits two frames) can make the `expect` pass while
  the native reply is still pending. Fix: put `clock data` after the input, before the
  `expect` that reads what its reply sets.
  (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, ios23 t5-pomodoro, 2026-10-05; iOS round 6.)

- **An `iframe` of `http://` from a named host loads under the agent and shows an
  App Transport Security error in the macOS app.** `http://localtest.me:5173/` or
  `http://example.com/` read "The resource could not be loaded because the App
  Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure connection" in the `.app`
  (an IP literal such as `http://127.0.0.1` loads). Cause: ATS reads the bundle's
  `Info.plist`, and `agent macos` runs the bare executable, which has none. Fix: set
  `host.macos.appTransportSecurity` (and `host.ios.…` for iOS) to
  `{ "allowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent": true }` in `app.json`; it relaxes web views
  only. On iOS, the host's wrapper for a remote HTTP page also uses HTTP:
  an HTTPS wrapper would still block that page as mixed content after the ATS
  opt-in. The inner iframe keeps its sandbox and its authored dimensions.
  To drive what a user sees on macOS, build with `bun exact.mjs mac --bundle` and set
  `EXACT_MAC_BIN` to the `.app`'s `Contents/MacOS/ExactMac`; the driver then skips its
  stale-build check, so rebuild the bundle before each drive. An app's own page
  (`src="assets/…"`) is served at `http://exact.localhost`: its `http:`
  sub-resources on loopback load, and one on a named host follows the same ATS
  setting. A sub-resource that fails is logged (`exact: iframe assets/…: <url>
  did not load (<reason>)`) (#135).
  (Issue #106, 2026-10-06.)

- **A focus ring never shows in an `agent macos` screenshot.** `type save key Tab`
  moves the focus (`state` reads it in `focus.logical`), yet neither `screenshot`
  nor `screenshot … window` shows AppKit's ring. Cause: the agent's app is an
  accessory whose window is ordered front but never key, and AppKit draws a focus
  ring only in the key window; nor can a script activate a dev build here (macOS
  refuses `activate` from the background). Fix: read the focus from `state`, and
  for the ring itself make the presenter's window an `NSPanel` with
  `.nonactivatingPanel` in an XCTest (it becomes key without activating the app)
  and read its pixels with `CGWindowListCreateImage`. (Issue #179, 2026-10-07.)

- **A drive script kept in the app folder makes the build stale.** Editing
  `verify.mjs` beside `app.contract` made the driver refuse the next drive until
  `bun exact.mjs web-build`. Cause: a file in the app folder counts as a build input
  unless it is an output (a screenshot, a log) or git-ignored outside the input trees
  (`data/`, `web/`, `assets/` and the like count even when ignored); any `.json`
  counts, since the bake captures it. Fix: keep drive scripts, evidence, logs and
  runtime files in the app's `.exact/` (no build, dev-loop watcher or freshness
  check reads a dot directory at the app's root), or outside the app folder.
  (Authoring bench, LLP 1087: five builders, 2026-10-05; Depot's evidence JSON,
  2026-10-05.)

- **A latency test passes at once, or a reply never lands.** Cause: every drive
  holds the app's clock, in every browser and on every host: `clock +N` moves the
  app's time and nothing else, while a `fetch`, a storage call or a stream's next
  message arrives on real time. Fix: `clock settle` to land what is in flight;
  `clock +N real` to let N ms of wall time pass with the clock moving alongside
  (polling, a server push, a measured latency). `state` lists what is pending.
  (Depot on three backends, 2026-10-05.)

- **A date input reads `10/05/2026` beside a label the app wrote in UTC.** Cause:
  `input type="date"`/`"time"` show the browser's own locale format and mean a
  local wall time, as on the web; the app's label used another zone. Fix: label in
  the viewer's zone, or pass `--locale` and `--time-zone` on a drive (`locale` and
  `time-zone` lines in a test file) so both agree and the run stays reproducible.
  (Depot, 2026-10-05.)

- **An iOS screenshot right after a tap shows a segmented control on its old
  segment.** The tree says the new one is selected. Cause: UIKit animates the
  selection on real time, and `clock +N` does not move it. Fix: `clock +1000 real`
  before the screenshot (it moves the app's clock that second too, so a timer due in
  it fires). (Authoring bench, t1-tip on iOS, 2026-10-05.)

- **The same test passes on the web and fails on iOS at a date past `max`.** Cause:
  the runner refuses a date, time or datetime outside `min`/`max` (the agent says the
  date was refused) on iOS, macOS, Linux and the wasm web; the JS web target keeps the
  value as a browser's date input does. Fix: test values inside the range, or the
  bound itself. (Authoring bench, t7-wizard on iOS,
  2026-10-05.)

- **The agent taps the simulator by screen coordinates** (`axe tap -x -y`,
  `simctl`), and the drive breaks whenever layout moves. Cause: the controls have
  no `testId`, or the driver was not used on iOS. Fix: give every control a
  `testId` and drive with `bun exact.mjs agent ios tree "tap <testId>"
  "screenshot s.png"`; find targets with `tree`, or `tree --ax` for the
  accessibility tree. (Exact-new iOS app feedback, 2026-10-04.)

- **Every date in a screenshot is 1 January 2026** (31 December 2025 west of UTC).
  Cause: the agent's clock starts at `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`, in UTC. Fix: `--epoch <ISO time> --time-zone <zone>` on
  `scripts/agent.mjs` for dates that read as intended and stay reproducible; in a test
  file, `epoch "…"` and `time-zone "…"` lines, so a run without the flags still means it.
- **A simulator measurement shows a 100–200 ms stall the app never makes.** A
  plain launch's frames hold 16.7 ms, but a run driven with `axe` shows one
  stall with no batch applied about 0.4 s after `axe` first reads the screen
  (`describe-ui`, `swipe`, `tap` by label), and every push afterwards is 30+ ms
  slower. Cause: an accessibility client turns on UIKit's accessibility runtime
  in the app; Time Profiler puts the whole stall in
  `-[UIApplication _accessibilityInit]` (loading the accessibility bundles,
  starting the server), and from then on UIKit keeps accessibility state for
  every view it moves. A phone pays this only with an assistive technology on
  (VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control). `xctrace` and `sample` attached to
  the app stall it too. Fix: time a plain launch; drive taps with `axe touch`
  (HID, no accessibility) or have the host press a row itself, and read frames
  from Save Trace or a temporary log, not from a run an accessibility client
  touched. (x2-perf, 2026-10-05.)
- **`axe` stops delivering taps.** Use `axe` only as a last resort, for native
  chrome only a normal launch presents (bars, `UIMenu`s); drive everything else
  with `agent ios` by `testId`. After `axe touch --down --up --delay` (a long
  press) or an `axe drag`, a following `axe tap` often reaches no window; it is
  intermittent, and a native bar button can miss the same way with no gesture
  before it. `axe touch --down --up` lands more often, not always. Fix: use the
  agent's own taps where it can; with `axe`, tap by touch, check every step with
  `axe describe-ui` before the next, and `xcrun simctl shutdown` / `boot` the
  simulator when taps stop landing. `axe` also cannot press tab bar items or
  `UIMenu` rows. (Signal Clone, builds 10 and 11; reproduced on `05d0c576e`.)
- **A `UISwitch` does not flip under `axe tap -x -y`.** Cause: a tap by
  coordinates resolves no element, so `--tap-style automatic` sends the
  simulator's own tap, a touch with no duration, and iOS 27's `UISwitch`
  ignores it: a bare UIKit app's switch does not flip either. A grouped
  list's toggle (LLP 1084) looks broken while its app logic is fine. Fix:
  `axe tap --id <testId>` (a switch element gets a physical touch),
  `axe tap -x <x> -y <y> --tap-style physical`, or
  `axe touch -x <x> -y <y> --down --up`; or the agent's `tap <testId>`.
  (Signal Clone Privacy, 2026-10-04.)

- **The software keyboard never shows on a simulator that drives have used.**
  A field takes focus (its caret blinks) but no keyboard rises, and
  `keyboardWillShow` never fires, so a keyboard-riding toolbar cannot be
  measured. Cause: after agent and `axe` drives the simulator was in
  hardware-keyboard mode, likely left by the HID input they inject; a
  headless simulator has no Simulator.app setting to show. Fix: reboot it
  (`xcrun simctl shutdown <udid>; xcrun simctl boot <udid>`), or toggle
  Connect Hardware Keyboard where Simulator.app is installed. (Signal Clone
  keyboard timing, 2026-10-05.)

- **A storage test fails with `storage is busy`, or storage is "unavailable in
  agent mode".** Cause: a drive has no storage unless it names a scratch store, and
  an open SQLite database locks its file, so a mutation and the refresh it triggers
  collide. Fix: `--storage <name>` on an `agent` drive (authored tests get a
  store of their own), and queue every `storage.sqlite.open` in `app.ts`
  ([the human guide](contract-for-humans.md#writing-the-data-module) shows one).
  (LLP 1086 reading-list example, 2026-10-04.)

- **An agent drive shows the app's defaults (a mock, an empty store) though
  the app's files are there.** Cause: without `--storage <name>` every
  `storage.fs` call in the data module throws "storage is unavailable in agent
  mode…", and a module that catches a missing config file falls back silently.
  The installed app's own files are not the drive's: a named scratch store lives
  apart (on iOS under `Library/Caches/exact/<app id>/agent/<name>/data`). Fix:
  `--storage <name>`, and copy the files the drive needs (a config, a saved
  store) into that folder first; `logs` shows the module's `console.log`.
  (Signal clone, live transport, 2026-10-05.)

- **A save that fails in the background is lost to the person.** An answer that
  saves unawaited has replied before the write fails, so no answer reports it;
  `logs` has `storage failed: …`, but the person sees nothing. Fix: keep the
  error in the module (`.catch((e) => { saveError = e.message; })`) and say it
  in the next answer. (LLP 1097, x2apps drums.)

- **A read misses a save chained on a promise.** `saving = saving.then(() =>
  storage.fs.atomicWriteFile(…))` issues the write only when the one before it
  lands, so a read issued meanwhile runs first and sees the older file. Cause:
  the module's storage runs in the order it was issued. Fix: call storage in
  the answer (`storage.fs.atomicWriteFile(…).catch(note)`) and let the queue
  order it. (LLP 1097 §1.)

- **Two awaited writes of one answer had another's write between them.**
  Answers interleave at their awaits, as two async calls do on the web. Fix: put
  writes that must stay together in one `transaction` (SQLite) or one operation.
  (LLP 1097 D4.)

## Working on exact2 itself

- **A bisect that shares another worktree's Cargo target directory builds
  stale code.** `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` pointed at one worktree while checking out
  older commits in another left generated enums (`PropId`, `Stdlib`) from the
  wrong commit, and the build failed for no reason in either tree until a
  full `cargo clean` (65 GiB). Give a bisect or a second worktree its own
  target directory. (2026-10-06.)

- **A platform feature looks missing, and you start building it.** Cause: the
  feature already exists under a name you did not search for. Haptics
  (`haptic()`, `press-haptic`) were proposed as a new gap after they had
  landed. Fix: before calling something missing, search
  `docs/contract-for-agents.md` and the LLP index (`ls llp/`, then `grep -ril
  <term> llp`). Name the LLP that lacks it when you report the gap. (Signal
  Clone, 2026-10-04.)

- **`build.mjs --test --ios` never returns after the tests pass.** Cause:
  `xcodebuild test` can sit for ten minutes or more after `Test Suite 'Selected
  tests' passed` and its `Executed N tests` line, with or without your change
  (seen on 2026-10-05 on an iPhone 17 Pro simulator, Xcode 27). Fix: run it in
  the background with its log in a file, wait for the `Executed N tests …
  seconds` line of the whole run, read the verdict from it, then kill the
  `xcodebuild test` PID whose `-derivedDataPath` is under your own checkout.
  `build.mjs` then reports `BUILD INTERRUPTED`, which is not a test failure.
- **Conformance fails on apps you didn't touch.** Cause: `host/web-js/conform.mjs`
  compares against wasm dists under `--wasm-root` (default `/tmp/e3-wasm`, shared by
  every checkout), and without `--build` it uses whatever another checkout or an
  older commit left there. Fix: name the apps and pass `--build` with a
  `--wasm-root` of your own (`conform.mjs <app> --build --strict --wasm-root
  /tmp/<yours>`). With no apps named, an empty root compares nothing and passes.
- **A web size or speed number is inflated.** Cause: a development web build
  carries the agent adapter, install pages and the source map. Fix: measure the
  release: `host/web-js/build.mjs <app> --plan <wasm bake>/app.plan --production`,
  as `scripts/deploy.mjs` builds it.
  The current `metrics.mjs` app.js gate is a different measurement: it calls
  `host/web/build.mjs <app>-web` without `--production`, and prints its three
  app.js lines only with `--long`. Reproduce that invocation when investigating
  a gate violation; a release number cannot be substituted for it.
- **Host code must never set a scroll offset during a pan or fling.** An absolute
  `contentOffset` write while `isTracking`/`isDecelerating` cuts the reader's
  motion: frame rate holds, the motion is wrong ("janky but not dropping frames").
  Defer follows to the end of the drag or deceleration, and apply anchoring and
  estimate corrections as relative adjustments in the same layout pass (Signal
  Clone evening of 2026-10-02; `32805146`, `c03685dc`).
- **A copied Core Animation tree renders blank.** Calling `CALayer(layer:)`
  directly gives an empty layer: a measured copy had zero bounds and no fill
  or sublayers. For a capture, copy values into fresh layers and recursively
  copy children and masks. Keep the live hierarchy intact. (LLP 1083.000, Apple A2.)
- **An sRGB capture test changes the pixel it reads.** AppKit's
  `NSBitmapImageRep.colorAt` returns calibrated RGB even when the bitmap is
  sRGB. Converting that `NSColor` to sRGB again turned measured bytes
  `[128, 0, 127, 255]` into about 58% red and 57% blue. Compare the bitmap's
  components or bytes in its declared color space. (Apple A2 capture test.)
- **A canvas capture still shows the previous order after ranks flush.**
  Cached shadow layers are plain `CALayer`s: changing their `zPosition`
  outside a disabled-actions transaction implicitly animates the depth.
  Flush ranks before capture and disable actions for that flush, including
  mirror writes. A same-batch texture upload then sees the new front sibling.
  (LLP 1083.000, Astra 6 regression.)
- **A sub-agent's half-written crate breaks every build in the worktree.**
  Cause: a crate listed in the root `Cargo.toml`'s `members` is resolved by
  every `cargo` command, so one that does not parse or compile yet stops
  builds that never touch it (about ten minutes of the harness's build, LLP
  1101.002 §0 P15). Fix: list it in `exclude` while it is written, which lets
  `cargo build --manifest-path <it>/Cargo.toml` build it alone, and move it
  to `members` once that passes.
- **"I opened it in a terminal" is not "it is running".** `open -na
  Ghostty.app --args -e …` can return success while the window reports "The
  terminal failed to initialize". Before telling a person the app is up,
  confirm its process (`pgrep -f <binary>`) and kill a failed window's
  instance before retrying (LLP 1101.002 §0 P16).

- **An external native app rebuilds on every unchanged direct Cargo invocation.**
  Cargo treats a missing optional `assets`/`deck` input as perpetually dirty;
  watching its parent recursively would also watch app-local build outputs.
  Use the host builder (`bun exact.mjs windows` for a generated Windows game).
  It recomputes `EXACT_ASSET_ROOTS` before each Cargo invocation; the bake watches
  that inventory for first creation and existing roots for content changes.
  Do not set this variable to a fixed hand-maintained list for direct Cargo.
