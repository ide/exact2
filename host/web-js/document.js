// What a view says about its page's document (LLP 1048.003), for rt.js: its
// head (D1) and the element that scrolls it (D4); and which routes of its
// navigation roots it shows (LLP 1038 D6).
//
// The head is the runner's (runner/src/head.rs): the innermost active `head`
// wins field by field, a deeper head over a shallower one and, at one depth,
// the later in document order; a head inside a route its navigation root has
// not selected is inactive. A root is an element with `navigationBack` and
// `navigationKey`, its routes its children with a `navigationKey`, and the
// selected one the route whose key is the root's, when one is: read from
// those attributes, never from what the projection hides (`projectRoots`).
// After each commit's tree update, once the page has had a head, the active
// head is found again, so one that changes, leaves or is covered gives its
// fields to the next; the page's title and description follow it as the web
// host's `documentHead` writes them (document-glue.js), the page's own title
// where no head sets one.
