// The host makes one instance per session, at the first view or long call
// that needs it, and destroys it with the session, after its views. Its
// views receive it, so a view and a function share one object. Every entry
// (init, the views' create, props and destroy, `later`, `call`, `destroy`) is
// on the main thread (LLP 1067.000 D4); long work goes on the module's own
// queues, and a reply may be sent from any thread, once. `call` answers inside
// the TypeScript answer that asked, within its 100 ms budget, and holds the
// main thread while it runs: keep it to cheap queries. The web has no
// synchronous call, so a portable source falls back to `native.later`. `views` is the roster, read
// once per process. Each view instance subclasses `ExactNativeInstance`.
//
// A factory with `creation: .beforeFirstPaint` is made during the initial
// render, as built-in controls are, so it shows in the first frame; the
// default makes it after the first frame. The build writes those tags to
// `exact-before-first-paint.json` in the bundle, which tells the host to load
// this artifact before the first render.
//
// A factory that sets `reuse` opts its tag into reuse in a list (LLP 1068
// §4.8): the instance's `prepareForReuse` makes it as if created with no
// props, the next `setProps` is a first mount, and `events.load()` follows
// once no pixel of the last row's shows (the host keeps the view
// transparent until then).
//
// Hooks (LLP 1075.003 §3.2, iOS): the module also receives Exact's own
// UIKit objects at defined moments — a navigation controller when Exact
// builds it, a route when its controller is built, changed and ended — and
// acts back by clicking an authored control (`route.element(id)?.click()`).
// What Exact owns on each object is LLP 1075.003 §3.5's table; the rest is
// the app's. A route's `data-*` words are read by the typed keys the build
// writes from app.json `data` (`route.data[.title]`).
