// @ref LLP 1075.003 §3.7 — each tab's controller, made with the tab container
// and never replaced. "You can use navigation controllers or custom view
// controllers as the root view controller for a tab" (UITabBarController): a
// tab whose panel can hold more than one route, or whose route can show a
// header, is a navigation controller, which shows that header as the
// platform's navigation bar and hides the bar where its route shows none; a
// tab whose panel shows one fixed route with no header is a plain view
// controller (`Runner::panels_need_navigation` reads which from the plan, so
// it is known for a tab not built yet). A tab the runner has not built yet
// (§9.14) has its controller from launch, empty until its routes arrive.
