// A virtualized list's retired rows lend their views to the rows it builds
// next (LLP 1050.000's reuse, host side). The runner never reuses a view id
// (`runner/src/instance/collection/api.rs`): a row it retires is destroyed
// and the next is created under new ids. Building a row's views costs most
// of a row in UIKit — making each view and moving it into the window, where
// every view is visited again (traits, tint, registration) — and destroying
// one costs the same walk out. So a collection row whose whole subtree the
// batch destroys is parked instead: its views stay where they were, the root
// hidden, each one forgotten by the presenter and reset (`recycle`). A later
// row created in a batch, under a collection list, with the same shape (the
// kinds and child counts, in order) takes the parked views under its new ids
// (`rebind`) and applies its create ops to them. A parked tree never leaves
// its list, so nothing moves in or out of the window.
//
// The reset contract, what a reused view must not carry from its last row:
// - identity: the presenter's maps and indexes for the old id (`release`,
//   the destroy path's own), autofocus, the ChromeIndex's names;
// - props (cleared, so a prop the new row lacks is absent), style (replaced
//   whole by the create op), handlers (assigned; their recognizers follow);
// - geometry and presentation: frame, transform, translate/scale/rotate,
//   opacity, hidden; `content`; the create's frame and present ops set them;
// - paint: the text raster, paragraph and inline runs (the new row's
//   `paragraph` op sets its own), layout caches, the live-region text, the
//   layer's bitmap; a raster image, its sublayer and its load (the
//   generation moves, so no completion lands); the symbol's key (its size is
//   reported again for the new id), keeping the glyph view unless the new
//   node shows no symbol;
// - input and accessibility: interaction enabled, the element, traits,
//   label, value, hint, identifier, hidden-elements, all set again by props;
// - motion: an `svg`'s scene layers and every Core Animation spec the view
//   ran (`SvgHost.forget`, on release), so no animation of the old row
//   plays on the new one (LLP 1055 D8; the new row's scene op starts its
//   own). SVG elements are not views: an `svg` parks as one leaf.
// - identity (LLP 1068 §4.9): the view's `incarnation`, zeroed when it
//   parks, before the reset, and a never-used one issued at the take, in
//   the batch that installs its props and handlers; an asynchronous
//   callback captures it and is dropped when it changed.
// Heavy leaves (LLP 1068 §4.0): a video, web view, native-module view,
// canvas, input or text area with no node children is a hole in its row's
// shape. The row's other views park; the leaf is destroyed as any destroy
// goes, before they park, and the next row's leaf is built fresh by its
// create op. A material's effect view is dropped at park and made again
// from the next row's props (§4.1). Nothing heavy is reused.
// What makes a view ineligible instead of reset: a kind other than plain
// boxes, text, images, buttons, `svg`s, waiting scrolls and heavy leaves; a
// live UIScrollView; a platform subview other than the node's glyph, its
// material or its clip box; a placement; gesture recognizers or
// interactions (menus, reorder handles, drags) other than a context menu's
// at rest (LLP 1021 §5.1, `contextual`); a press, drag or swipe in
// progress, or a projected swipe row; focus, a focus ring, editing, a
// pending focus — on a heavy leaf too; flow shapes, a context transform, a
// pending scroll; a view kept by a modal's retiring root; a subtree node
// the batch does not destroy (it may be moving elsewhere).
// While VoiceOver or Switch Control runs nothing parks: its cursor stays on
// the element it was on, never on a view that is now another row.
