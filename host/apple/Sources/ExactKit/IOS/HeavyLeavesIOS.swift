// @ref LLP 1068 §5.1 (Q2, ruled 2026-09-27) — a costly heavy leaf is not
// created mid-fling: a declared deviation, narrower than LLP 1050.000 D3.
//
// During user motion (a drag or a fling faster than a viewport a second), a
// video, web view or native-module view whose measured creation cost
// exceeds the frame gets no platform view while its row is built. Its node
// exists, its box is laid out and painted, the rest of its row is built;
// when the list slows under that speed or comes to rest, the view is made,
// one a frame, with the node's latest props. Defined:
// - props: the latest at creation; the ones between are never applied, as a
//   batch coalesces them;
// - events: none before creation (`load`, `canplay`, a module's own come
//   later, as after a slow load);
// - hits: the box takes them as an empty box of its kind; a touch down on
//   it makes the view at once (a pointer-down is not motion);
// - focus: a focus move into the leaf makes it at once; while VoiceOver or
//   Switch Control runs nothing waits;
// - retirement: a row retired first makes nothing;
// - the agent: `state` lists the waiting leaves (`pool.pendingLeaves`, and
//   `native.pending` on the node); `clock settle` makes every one.
// Near the viewport only (2026-09-28, the Extra Heavy feed; LLP 1068
// §5.2): a heavy leaf in a collection's row is made when its row comes
// within a quarter viewport of what shows, as UIKit's collection view
// prepares a cell just before it appears, not when the collection's lead
// builds its row one to three viewports ahead. The row, its box and the
// rest of its content are built as before (LLP 1050.000's never-blank rule
// is about rows; this is a leaf, as above). Once made, a leaf stays until
// its row retires.
// A kind is measured at each creation (the median of its last five, the
// process's first of each kind, which pays for loading, left out); one not
// yet measured, a GPU canvas, a 2D canvas and an editor are never held, and a
// video only when its box does not wait on its metadata (both sides set).
