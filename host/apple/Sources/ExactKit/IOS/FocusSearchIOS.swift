// UIKit's focus search, answered for exact2's own views (LLP 1008 §9).
// On an iPad with a hardware keyboard UIKit runs a focus system. While no
// item holds UIKit focus — exact2's keyboard focus is the first responder's
// (Tab is its own key command) and none of its views is a UIKit focus item
// — every view that appears or hides asks for a focus update
// (`-[UIFocusSystem _focusEnvironmentDidAppear:]` and `…WillDisappear…`),
// and each update searches for a default item to defer focus to: a focus
// map of the window, every view's frame and eligibility. A list scrolling
// slowly built, parked and took back rows all the time and paid that
// search for each one — 13% of the main thread on an M1 iPad Pro at
// 1k pt/s, and one 20-40 ms frame a second once its throttle backed off —
// and found nothing each time. So the viewport, the one way into a
// session's views, answers the search with no items unless a view UIKit
// can focus may be in the window: anything exact2 did not make itself (a
// field, a text area, a web view, a segmented control, a menu's button, a
// swipe's table, a platform view). Then the search is given those views
// alone, each a focus item container of its own: a feed that always holds a
// field, a web view, a map or a player otherwise had UIKit walk every view
// of the session for each update — 30–40 ms a second of an iPad's main
// thread in a fast fling of the Extra Heavy feed — to reach the few it can
// focus. Only the viewport answers: UIKit logs, at every init, each view of
// a class that answers `focusItems(in:)`.
