//! Exit animation, layout transition and the presentation values the engine
//! changed (LLP 1063; LLP 1002 §3).
//!
//! A receipt's exits name the one view of each removed subtree that leaves
//! (the kernel's rule). The host tells the presenter `exit` before the
//! batch's destroys, withholds the destroys of that view and everything
//! under it, keeps its motion node, and plays its `-exact-exit-animation` from the
//! commit's clock; when the engine passes the end, one `destroy` of the
//! leaving view lets the presenter drop the lot. The leaving view is not in
//! the mirror, so no frame, style or children op reaches it: it keeps its
//! last laid-out frame while its old siblings take its place.
//!
//! A node with a `-exact-layout-transition` has its laid-out box in its parent
//! (`Kernel::layout_box`) observed as `Property::Layout` after every layout
//! that moved or resized it. The engine's transition rules apply (first seen
//! takes the value, an interrupt starts from where it is); the presenter gets
//! what the engine shows against the laid-out box as a `layout` offset and
//! scale, applied outermost from the box's top-left corner as a web FLIP
//! is, so a frame is never re-laid out per tick and a moving parent carries
//! its children. A resize takes new boxes at once. A node that gains the row
//! is seeded with its box before the commit's layout, so its first move
//! after gaining it animates, as a CSS transition gained in the same style
//! change runs.
