//! What a native container covers of a box (LLP 1075.003 §3.5): the iOS
//! navigation and tab containers report their bars over a route, and the
//! header a bar replaces; one layout for all of a turn's reports. And the
//! containing block a native container gives a subtree it shows in a view
//! of its own (LLP 1115.002 D8.2): a split's pane, a sheet, and where it
//! shows that subtree's root when it does not lift it to the top layer (a
//! stack's route, LLP 1123 D2), which only the runner's geometry reads.
//! And the margins UIKit's own list gives a grouped list's cards and cells,
//! which split placeholders a pane shows (LLP 1116.006 D2), the size a
//! person dragged a box's `resize` grip to (`Runner::resize_box`), and a
//! content owner's values (LLP 1123 D9).
