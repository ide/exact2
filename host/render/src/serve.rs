//! The server (LLP 1048.000 D10, D11): `<app>-render --serve <dist>`
//! renders a page per request, on loopback, from the built web app.
//!
//! A route declared `render=build`, `cached` or `request`, and any location
//! the router sends to its not-found route, is rendered with a new
//! runner and module realm (D10), then composed over the
//! built shell ([`crate::page`]). A `client` route gets the shell. Files
//! under `dist/` are served as they are; `/.exact/health` answers `ok`.
//! Renders run on a fixed set of workers behind a bounded queue: a request
//! that finds the queue full is a 503 at once. A failed render, or one that
//! panics, is a 500 and the server keeps serving. Each render prints one
//! line: location, status, time, answers, pending and bytes.
//! Successful `cached` pages are also kept at the origin for their public
//! lifetime, bounded to 64 locations and 32 MiB. Other routes render fresh.
