//! A page sent in two parts (LLP 1071 D6, the early flush): the head of a
//! JavaScript page as the request arrives, before any of its data is asked
//! ([`crate::page::head_js`]), then the rest when the render is done
//! ([`crate::page::body_js`]), as one chunked, compressed response.
//!
//! Only a browser's navigation (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`) to a rendered
//! route that isn't the not-found one is sent this way, and never a CDN's
//! request, a conditional one, or a `HEAD`: those wait for the render and
//! get its status, validators and caching as before. Once the head has gone
//! the status has too, so a flushed page is `200` and `private, no-cache`
//! (`no-store` for a `request` route), with no ETag. What the render then
//! decides goes in the page instead:
//! - a head `status` (404, 410, 503) or a render at its deadline: the
//!   document the buffered answer would carry (at the deadline, with its
//!   placeholders and the checkpoint listing what is pending, which the
//!   runtime asks again), and the head's `robots` meta — never kept at the
//!   origin;
//! - a render that fails or panics: the same "couldn't be rendered" text a
//!   500 carries, after the head;
//! - a 200: kept at the origin as a buffered render is, so the next request
//!   is a hit with its ETag.
//!
//! A crawler, `curl` or a CDN sends no `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, so every client
//! that reads a status still gets the right one; the server's log line has
//! it for flushed pages too.
//!
//! 103 Early Hints: before a flushed page, and before a CDN's buffered
//! render, the entry's `modulepreload`s go as `Link` headers. Chrome acts
//! on a 103 only over HTTP/2 or later, so on this HTTP/1.1 server's own
//! connections it changes nothing (the flushed head names the same
//! preloads at the same moment); a CDN in front, speaking HTTP/2 to the
//! browser, can forward it while this server renders.
