# What Exact v1 Does Not Do

This is the most valuable file in the repo. It is longer than the doing-list on purpose.

## The bar that makes this list derivable

v1 is done when **one real application** — not a demo — runs from a single Contract
source on web, macOS, iOS, and Linux, hitting the time budgets in `RULES.md`.

**Decided (Charlie, 2026-08-30):** the Caltrain app is the one that defines v1 — it
already exists in Contract, it has real lists, navigation, search, text, and theming, and
"does it still work" is answerable in seconds — **and Weird Castle's wordmark is in v1
beside it**, which puts one bundled brand face in scope and nothing else about that app.
Everything not required by those two does not exist. What the wordmark unblocks: a
declared font, LLP 1019. Fonts were never on this list, so nothing comes off for them.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-05):** the Markdown viewer (LLP 1033) is a third
consumer: macOS file opening and comfortable reading first, shared with iOS and
web. Take: native-module implementation (LLP 1024, awaiting a consumer) moves
behind the reader. Blog/CMS and publishing remain out.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-07: "make a real app that uses them"):** Fieldnotes
is the storage consumer: notes in SQLite, backups in app-scoped files, and a
multiline editor on web and Apple. Take: further general-purpose API expansion
waits behind proving these shipped bindings in the app; Snapback2 stays deferred.

**Taken off (Charlie, 2026-09-23: "Take off Messages as the Snapback4
consumer. We don't need that on the list"):** the trade for web rendering
(LLP 1048, below). Messages is no longer the Snapback4 consumer admitted
2026-09-12; Interview, built on Snapback4, is. Snapback2 stays deferred.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-14):** language parity for existing app operations
(LLP 1027.001): shared standard text/URL helpers, portable storage requests,
reusable mixed composition, and Fieldnotes backup in either language. Unblocks
moving app logic without changing durable data or permissions. Take: remove
app-private text helpers and Update Lab's private composer; generalized native
views and multi-module scheduling stay behind this consumer.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-14: "let's build this now"):** optional worker
placement for data modules (LLP 1027.002) — one module instance, one executor
owner, values cross and the runner commits; `main` stays the default and the
manifest opts a module in per platform. Unblocks app computation off the UI
thread with the same inputs, results, grants and durable data, ahead of a
measured hitch, for the story and because the limits will be hit. Take: Rust
on a web Worker waits behind a consumer that needs it (placement is
language-neutral on native, TypeScript-only on the web); a second worker, job
pools and load balancing stay out; the mixed-resource first-frame bake is
built with it rather than queued. The measurement bar in LLP 1027.002 §2 says
when a worker is claimed to help.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-16):** graceful-overload design and two bounded,
synthetic stress consumers (LLP 1041): Messages interaction under load and
async completion storms. Unblocks measuring queue pressure, UI settlement
bursts, and large-history costs on existing hosts. Take: broad new benchmark
apps and a generic job scheduler stay behind these two; no sixth blocking
check, additional worker pool, or parallel layout is admitted by these examples.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-16, Astra xhigh campaign):** add gigantic Markdown
and continuous native resize to LLP 1041's stress consumers; evolve bounded
native scheduling and viewport collections against these workloads. Take: more
showcase apps and speculative general job pools wait behind measured improvements
to these three. Existing ordered-effect and capability boundaries still apply.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-16: "Work through all four"):** continuously
interactive Messages, photo zoom, virtualized reorder and a draggable sheet with
a nested collection (LLP 1041 §8.5). Unblocks proving gesture takeover, collection
lifetime and background scheduling together on the existing hosts. Take: other
showcase apps and decorative effects wait behind these four and the original
three workloads. Shared-element presentation and the bounded geometry/motion
work those consumers need are admitted; a generic gesture arena, second
application-state graph and speculative parallel layout remain out.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-28: exact2's web support, not "Exact 3"):** the
web build's JS target (LLP 1071): the same Contract compiled ahead of time to one
ES module over a ~20 KB runtime, the DOM as the tree, used by default for an app
it compiles; the Rust render host stays the primary pre-render and the JS render
the option (his ruling of the same day). Unblocks a web first interaction in
about a tenth of the wasm target's bytes. What the JS target refuses fails an
app's build (a game builds wasm); left open: state carried across the
dev loop's reload and the rest of the agent (node detail, iframe outlines,
accessibility props, gesture and key deliveries; the smoke's fixtures build `--wasm`);
the JS render path's documents (canonical, og, robots, status, sitemap).
Take: none named yet (LLP 1071 §8 asks). A Rust source's Canvas 2D surfaces and
declared fonts closed on 2026-09-29 (Charlie's ask, relayed; LLP 1071 §7), as did
virtualized lists, `reachstart`/`reachend`, a dynamic `line-height`, and an app
outside the repo (Bluesky builds on the JS target); so did dynamic composite rows
(`clip-path`, SVG paint and dashes, `filter`, gradients, `animation`, the timeline
rows, an eased `transition`) and full SVG (Sparkline and SVG Gallery build); `now()`
readers, the reserved sources `exactPage`, `exactDelivery` and `exactSurface`,
localized strings, `openAuthSession` and `scrollIntoView` (LLP 1071 §7, "The runtime
gaps"); and `pan`, `panrelease`, `swiperight` and spring transitions over the motion
engine (Spark, Messages and Messages Stress build); and `select`, over the web
host's own Markdown editor, and the DOM's `cancel` (Markdown Stress builds); and
text around shapes over the web host's exclusions executor (Reflow and Text Flow
build); and the height and transform drags (`heightrelease`, `transformgeometry`,
`transformrelease`); and exit animations and layout transitions (presence-glue.js); and the build's gaps: the GPU module, Canvas 2D drawn by a TypeScript
source, a TypeScript and a Rust source in one app, native modules, delivery (the web
root publishes the JS build of the bake's plan; the web needs no update client) and
the dev loop's rebuild (~0.1 s an edit) — LLP 1071 §7, "Build and toolchain gaps";
and the reorder drag (`reorderdrop`, reorder on a virtualized list) and `frame`/
`measure` (Interaction Gallery and Exact Live build); and
files and storage: a file input and `showPicker`, `saveFile`, the document
pickers, `share`, and app storage for TypeScript and Rust sources (Fieldnotes and
Markdown build) — LLP 1071 §7, "Files and storage";
and press feedback, and every dynamic style row (shadows, font stacks, line clamp,
numeric variants, backdrop blur, press scale, a pressed node's animation and
transition, an SVG `transform`, markers and `url(#…)` references); and native
clients on the dev URL (the JS loop forwards them to the resident loop's producers,
which build the bake, not the wasm), the router sweep on the JS target,
delivery's bake without `app.wasm`, and animated images on the agent's clock — LLP
1071 §7, "Retiring the wasm target on the web". Games stay on the wasm target
(Charlie, 2026-09-29).

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-17: one impressive demo on iPhone, macOS and web):**
Exact Live combines crew chat, photos, a runbook and background jobs in one
authored workspace, using existing hosts and data seams. Unblocks showing the
interaction and performance work together in a coherent application. Take:
additional standalone showcase apps wait behind this composition; existing full
stress workloads and controls remain intact. No new UI framework, general job
scheduler or cross-device synchronization service is implied.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-20: "make an app that shows off clones of" the
Pretext demos):** Reflow (`apps/reflow`) is a seventh showcase — balls, the
illustrated dragon, masonry, a drag-to-reflow magazine, proportional ASCII
art, an occlusion-culled wall and an obstacle-aware spread — to show exact2
has Pretext's capabilities: text around shapes from the kernel (LLP 1043.000)
and heights-before-layout from a data crate that measures with advances read
out of the app's font files at build time and breaks lines with the hosts'
own `exact-textflow` walker. Unblocks a public comparison on every host with
no new kernel row and no app-side measurement seam. Take: no Pretext library,
no runtime font parsing, and auto-height flow (LLP 1043.000 §8) stays owed
(built 2026-09-26 as §8's Stage 2, a bounded re-layout restricted to block
contexts; **accepted (Charlie, 2026-09-27)** on condition that `metrics.mjs`
shows a still layout costs about nothing and names the worst case for a page
with several shapes);
the dragon is a polygon, not a `shape-outside: <image>`.
Linux skips Thai word breaking (Charlie, 2026-09-28): with no segmenter
there, flowed Thai, Lao, Khmer and Myanmar text breaks only at spaces; no
ICU4X dictionaries. Web and Apple take their platforms' words (LLP 1043.000 §8).

**Expanded (orchestrator for Charlie, 2026-10-05, LLP 1093 §8: "admission via
your offered trade"):** CSS multi-column (`columns`, `column-count`,
`column-width`, `column-gap: normal`, `column-fill`, solid `column-rule`) and
the break rules that only mean something inside it (`widows`, `orphans`,
`break-before`/`-after`/`-inside` without page or region values). Native hosts
fragment through the kernel's cut, and the web is the browser's own multicol,
held to Chrome. The reader app's diary is the consumer: pagination and a
two-page spread from one flow. Unblocks book pagination without a polled
height or a duplicated chapter. Take: LLP 1043.000 stage 5
(`shape-outside: <image>`, the dancer's traced silhouette) moves behind
LLP 1093 stage 2. Still out: `column-span`, regions, paged media and `@page`,
`box-decoration-break: clone`, and slicing decorated, fixed-height, flex-row
and grid boxes (LLP 1093 §5).

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-21: "design and build a markdown editor that works
across all Exact platforms"):** WYSIWYG Markdown editing and one-node Markdown
reading (LLP 1045), Interview first. Unblocks rich posts that stay plain text
in storage and scan cheaply. Take (Charlie, 2026-09-21): the reader's open
follow-ups other than code-block highlighting (heading anchors, file
watching, the compact folder layout) wait behind it; no rich value type,
collaboration or HTML paste import. **Refined (Charlie, 2026-09-21:
"move forward with your plan"):** Native editing stays on TextKit 2;
dependable source editing precedes further marker hiding, with Interview as
the first consumer. **Refined again (Charlie, 2026-09-22: "let's remove
codemirror"):** the web editor is dependency-free `contentEditable`, and the
editing rules are one crate for every host (`markdown/editor/`), shipped on
the web as its own wasm fetched only when a Markdown textarea mounts: an app
without an editor pays nothing for it. CodeMirror is not admitted.
`fileinput` comes off in one form (LLP 1045 D10): an image/video picker for
captioned figures — no camera, no generic file input. **Widened (Charlie,
2026-09-27, LLP 1069.010):** a picker for the types an app declares in
`file_handlers`, plus export and import copies to and from `app:/`. Unblocks
the Markdown reader's remaining surfaces and Fieldnotes' backups. Take: none
named (Charlie: "idk what to trade it for, maybe relax the limit slightly").
Still no picker for any file, and no `capture` on the picker (the camera is a
native module, §Components, 2026-10-02). Linux editing is v2
(Charlie, 2026-09-21): web, iOS and macOS first; Linux reads.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-21):** ship the full game engine from Black's
`lane/game` as an optional add-on, with a full-screen Weird Castle demo.
`game/` is a separate Cargo workspace; games opt in through their GPU artifact,
loaded after first paint. No core crate depends on the engine, renderer, physics
or audio. The core gains only canvas input, state publication, inspection and
save/restore seams. Take: further standalone showcase work waits behind this
consumer; no default engine linkage, core feature matrix or extra blocking gate.
See LLP 1046 §5 and LLP 1046.003.

**Clarified (Charlie, 2026-09-23, LLP 1046.006.000 §7):** game-owned render
hooks and reusable shader-packaging support in shared build tools are within
that optional add-on's scope. The same take holds; core apps gain no engine
dependency. Weird Waters may prove the hooks privately alongside independent
public fixtures on web, macOS and iOS.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-23: "ok let's do pre-rendering etc."; "let's use
Interview as our website"):** web rendering across the curve (LLP 1048), with
Interview as its consumer: build-time and per-request pages from a native Rust
renderer, adoption in place of hydration, route payloads, cache policies,
inferred partial prerendering and streaming. Unblocks websites that crawlers,
link previews and readers without JavaScript can read, and that paint before
the runtime loads. Take: Messages as the Snapback4 consumer (above). Still
refused: progressive forms (server actions without the runtime) and
server-driven UI; no Node on the render path.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-23: "let's build it in exact2 and see how we
stack up"):** RealWorld/Conduit (`apps/realworld`), the spec'd Medium clone,
against its hosted API, measured for browser load against a React 19 build of
the same spec. Unblocks comparing exact2 with React on an app we didn't design.
Take: no measurement harness, script or check in this repo; the React build and
the numbers live outside it. Other benchmark and showcase apps wait behind this
one. js-framework-benchmark stays out (Charlie, 2026-09-23: "let's skip it"):
its harness needs a table and Bootstrap class names the web host doesn't emit.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-27: "Admit Bluesky as a consumer"):** the Bluesky
client (`ccheever/bluesky-exact2`, outside the repo, consuming exact2 by path) is
a consumer. It unblocks what its port asks for (LLP 1054, 1054.000): arguments
on list edges (1054.000.006, landed with this entry), view-side formatting
(1054.000.003) and bounded feeds (1058 P4), each still held to its own review.
Take (proposed with the admission; Charlie may name another): new in-repo
showcase apps wait behind Bluesky's asks. **Clarified (Charlie, 2026-09-27,
LLP 1069.006):** its OAuth sign-in, replacing app passwords, is one of those
asks: the system-browser auth session and the P-256 keys it needs (LLP
1069.005). No trade beyond the admission's.

**Expanded (Charlie Cheever, 2026-09-26: approved implementing LLP 1024):**
native modules — a hyphenated tag is a `NativeView` backed by the app's one
module artifact — with a photo-editor example as the consumer. Unblocks a
platform widget without a host change or a new node type. Take: LLP 1024 §7's
(§Components loses no line; `terminal` and friends stay out as built-in tags).

**Expanded (Charlie Cheever, 2026-10-01: asked for LLP 1075.003 implemented,
its recommended rulings):** native platform control on Apple: hooks on an
app's module that receive Exact's own UIKit objects, `data-*` attributes
declared in `app.json`, a public route-content seam, and Exact's own navigation
bar and retained tab container built on it. James's app is the consumer, and
`apps/native-fixture` the one in the repo. Unblocks reaching UIKit's navigation
and tab containers without patching Exact. Take: new per-property UIKit rows
and any SDK-wide binding generator wait behind it. One exception to "No public
API stability": this surface (LLP 1075.003 §3.9) is named, and a break is one
commit that changes the fixture and says what to change. Still refused: a
deprecation window, native property names in Contract, and a JavaScript UI
tier.
**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03: tab badges, "I think", kept minimal):** a
tab's child that is a filled box holding one text is its tab bar item's badge
(LLP 1075.003 §9.9), the box the web paints. The Signal Clone's unread-chats
count on Chats is the consumer. Unblocks a native tab badge with no module.
Take: none offered; waived by Charlie's approval. No badge attribute and no
badge on a bare tablist's bar.
**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03: "Declarative nav basics"):** a heading's
group as a richer title (avatar, subtitle, press), the tab bar hidden for a
route pushed while the authored tablist is, no bar for a route with no
header, and a named scroller under an inline title's bar (LLP 1075.003
§9.10). The Signal Clone's conversation header and photo viewer are the
consumer. Unblocks them with no module. Take: none offered; waived by
Charlie's approval. No new attribute, no title menu, no bar added by a route.
**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03: "A native grouped-list role mapped to
UICollectionView list layout"):** `list appearance="auto"` is a grouped list
(LLP 1084): sections with a header and footer, rows read by shape, UIKit's
own list on iOS and a measured sheet elsewhere; `listStyle` picks
`inset-grouped`, `grouped` or `plain`. The Signal Clone's settings screens are
the consumer. Unblocks native cell highlight, separators, dynamic type and
VoiceOver rows in a settings screen without a module. Take: none offered;
waived by Charlie's approval. No sidebar styles, no virtualized grouped list,
no grouped swipe actions.
**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-06, via the lead: "Recs seem good. Approve and
push"):** hooks on every platform and what the agent sees of them (LLP
1075.003.000.001). The changes:
- app and window scopes;
- a frame clock and timers on the session clock;
- `input(text)` on an authored field;
- Linux and Windows hooks: an overlay the hook replaces whole, and input it
  only observes;
- development-only diagnostics (`log`, `count`, `measure`, spans, `publish`)
  and Exact's own timing of each call;
- owned regions and parts in `tree`;
- a crash breadcrumb;
- per-platform hook words checked by the delivery classifier.

`perf hooks` is a form of `perf`. Tapping a part is a form of `tap`, by real
platform input only. Neither is a new operation. The consumers are the Signal
Clone and `apps/native-fixture`. The ruling admits three pieces of
apparatus: `exact.mjs hook <word>`, `EXACT_HOOKS=off` and the template's
`AGENTS.md` hooks section. Take: none offered; waived by Charlie's approval.
Still refused: claiming input on a painting host (a gesture arena), a tap that
runs hook code by name, a hook that writes Contract state or dispatches, a
node-scoped frame ticket, diagnostics collected in production, and JavaScript
above the data seam on native. Android stays below, named but not built.

## Surfaces

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-13):** replace app Rust below the data seam with
a separately linked native or interpreted Wasm module, in development and
production (LLP 1029.000). Unblocks business-logic updates without a host rebuild.
Take: multi-module scheduling and generalized native-view module loading stay
behind this single data-module consumer; Windows and Android hosts remain below.
**Refined (Charlie, 2026-09-14):** optional Wasm-first/native promotion for
explicitly stateless modules removes OS loading from the update latency path.
Generic executor-private state migration stays out; this is one committed
generation with an executor change, not a second app reload or patch protocol.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03, waiver: "So maybe we just say we support all
Apple platforms in-tree, and out-of-tree is for like Amazon's new TV operating
system thing"; "yeah, this sounds good, let's pull it in"):** the Apple
platforms UIKit covers are in-tree surfaces: tvOS (Doug Lowder's port,
`host/apple/build.mjs --tvos`; the Siri Remote's focus, Select and Menu) and
visionOS when someone ports it. Each is a variant of the iOS presenter, not a
new one: shared Swift admits it beside `os(iOS)`, Rust cfgs beside
`target_os = "ios"`, and its own code compiles into its own binary alone.
Unblocks Caltrain on an Apple TV. watchOS, which has no UIKit, stays out. A
platform with its own UI stack (Amazon's Vega OS) is a host outside this
repository, on the plan, runner and agent seams; its RFC is owed. The take is
waived.

**Admitted (Charlie, 2026-10-06: "this is pretty great. commit and push this
and document that TUI is now an officially supported platform for Exact2";
LLP 1101, 1101.000, 1101.001):** the terminal is an officially supported,
in-tree surface. `host/terminal` (`exact-terminal`) runs a terminal entry —
its own root `.contract`, compiled under the terminal profile (lengths in
`ch`/`lh`, the schema's `terminal` admission) — inline (settled transcript
entries printed once into the terminal's own scrollback, the live tail
redrawn; selection, copy and tmux stay the terminal's) or full screen.
Unblocks apps authored for the terminal: the coding harness
(`apps/harness`, real models through OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI and
Ollama) and the todo fixture (`apps/todo`). A terminal entry is a separate
application root on a separate medium, not a platform override (LLP 1101
D9, §Authoring models). No take was named; the ruling stands as its own
waiver until Charlie names one.

- **Windows.** A working Direct2D host exists in the old repo. It is real work, and it
  doubles the native matrix. **Admitted (Charlie, 2026-10-04):** "make an exact2
  implementation for the Windows platform, including the game engine" for standalone
  Skirmish (LLP 1015.000). Take: single-player first; multiplayer and general Windows
  app expansion wait behind the working game. The engine remains optional.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-04):** "something simple and app-like that uses a
  lot of windows native stuff" admits Windows Desk, a bounded text workspace
  using Contract and an app-local Win32 control presenter. General Windows
  control parity remains behind these two consumers; no additional showcase
  or framework is admitted by this example.
- **Android.** Same.

Every surface multiplies the sweep, the presenter count, and the number of ways one
change can break.

## Authoring models

- **React tier.** The door stays open — meaning we design nothing that forecloses it.
  We do not build it. No React Facet bindings, no RecipeIR generation, no dual-framework
  parity gate. One authoring model, one set of bugs. Logic below the data seam is
  TypeScript by default or Rust (LLP 1027; Charlie, 2026-09-03); nothing runs
  JavaScript above it — not in Contract, not in the tree, not before first pixel.
- **Rust Native roots.** No Rust-owned UI roots, no deployment-manifest registrations,
  no app-ABI generator.
- **Platform-suffixed route overrides** (`.native.tsx`, `.mac.tsx`, ...). One route, one
  file. If a platform needs different behavior, that is a branch inside the component or
  a bug in the presenter. A terminal entry (LLP 1101) is a separate application root on
  a separate medium, not a platform override; GUI surfaces still have one source.

## Features carried over as "no"

**Runtime**

- GPU / WebGPU substrate. The old repo carries ~139,000 lines of Rust adapter code
  across two files, neither marked generated. The door stays open the way React's
  does — we design nothing that closes it: an owned-pixel surface is a leaf node
  with a kernel-owned box (like `NativeView`), GPU content never influences layout,
  the host owns the frame, and animatable properties are extensible (CSS
  `@property`). When it is built, it compiles no shaders at runtime (LLP 0559 F8).
- ~~Server generation in every form: SSR, streaming, static export, progressive
  forms, hydration, route payloads, response caching.~~ Moved 2026-09-23 (Charlie,
  LLP 1048): static and per-request pages, streaming, adoption in place of
  hydration, route payloads and cache policies are on the doing-list (the
  entry above). Still refused: progressive forms and server-driven UI.
- Aquifer data tier, durable worker tier, capability capsules, durable capability grants.
- ~~Snapback / update economy.~~ Moved 2026-09-03 (Charlie: "you can pull out snapback
  for now"), in LLP 1026 D11's minimal form only: an installed app fetches a signed
  bundle of static files from a baked-in origin, after first pixel, into an on-disk
  store, for its next launch (LLP 1030 for every layer; 1030.000 for the verb). Unblocks
  deploying a change to installed apps from a bake and an upload. Take: `EXACT_DEV_PLAN`'s
  file poll and the two dev-only URL loaders collapse into that one store with two
  policies (1026 D12) — fewer paths after than before. What stays refused, as
  the *service* half of the old economy: per-user targeting, cohorts by identity, an
  update console, server-side anything, push delivery.
- Hot revision surfaces, staged reload. (HBC compilation came off 2026-09-03 for the
  *bake only* — LLP 1027 D5: `hermesc` runs at build beside the Contract compiler;
  nothing compiles at runtime, and the lean VM a host links cannot. A dev reload *carries
  state* — slots by name where their types still fit, settled resources where
  their arguments still match, the clock — and is otherwise a restart: no patch
  format, no generations, no identity matching. LLP 1007 §6; Charlie, 2026-08-28.)
- Islands and inline islands.
- Cross-runtime shared data in production. **Measured exception (Charlie,
  2026-09-18, LLP 1027.003 §9):** all four isolated transfer/storage directions
  were tried. The small conversion and app fixes are selected for delivery;
  immutable views, typed buffers and a mutable shared heap remain research.
  **Priority (Charlie, 2026-09-18, LLP 1027.004):** bounded Messages answers come
  next. Unblocks keeping producer, transfer and settlement work proportional to
  the requested window. Take: further shared-representation tuning and generic
  arrival-time structural reconciliation move behind this consumer. No new
  benchmark app, scheduler, core feature matrix or second application-state graph.
  Production ABI changes, arbitrary object unification and a default shared heap
  remain unselected.
- Notifications were never on the doing list (LLP 1069 §1 ranked them first of
  the "next"). **Expanded (waived by the orchestrator under Charlie's 2026-10-04
  delegation, "make decisions without me"):** local notifications by the web's
  Notification API names — `showNotification` now or at a time, `closeNotification`
  by tag — under the existing `device.notifications` grant. Consumers: the Habits
  app's reminders (x2apps habits F13) and Dash's price alerts, both faked as
  in-app banners. Unblocks a reminder that reaches the person outside the window.
  Take: none offered. Still refused: push delivery from a server, actions and
  replies on a notification, badges, repeating schedules, and a readable
  permission fact.

**Components** — roughly 15 built-in tags, not 40; roughly 12 Facet components, not 47.
**Restated (Charlie, 2026-09-27, LLP 1069.001):** the tag count guards against
invented components, not HTML's own elements. A built-in tag is an HTML
element with HTML's meaning; `select` and `option` are admitted on that
reading. Nothing that isn't HTML is added by it.

- No `lottie`, `rive`, `fileinput`, `pager`. Video admitted 2026-09-18
  (Charlie: design video and build a keyboard-resizing player; LLP 1042). Unblocks
  the native/web video consumer; router/viewport-fact integration (1038/1039)
  follows this player. (`webview` came off
  2026-08-30 as LLP 1020's `iframe` — it unblocks Weird Castle's entire content
  model, the client that exists to surface Castle web decks; the take: LLP 1013
  view transitions moved behind the deck lane. LLP 1020 §6. What stays no from
  exact1's webview: `top` topology, navigation policy, the controller ops, `allow`,
  author-facing `srcdoc` — each with its return trigger in LLP 1020 §5.)
- **Expanded (LLP 1096; admitted by the orchestrator under Charlie's
  2026-10-04 delegation, "make decisions without me"):** short sounds an
  action can schedule: a `sound` declaration (a WAV in `assets/`, at most 10
  s), `playSound(src, at=, gain=, group=)`, `playSounds(hits)` and
  `stopSounds(group=)`. The runner keeps the voice table; the web plays
  through Web Audio, Apple through one mixer in an arm loaded on demand;
  Linux and Windows keep the record; `app.json`'s `audio_session` picks the
  Apple session. Consumers: drums (R1–R3), snake (F1), trivia (F5).
  Unblocks a retriggered, sample-accurate hit without two media elements per
  voice or a 2 ms poll. Take (offered in LLP 1096 §9 Q1, accepted): the
  `audio` element stops being the sound-effect path — R1's retrigger change
  to the media glue is not built, and the guide's "Ding" recipe and LLP 1042
  §8's sound-effect paragraph are deleted. Round-1 review A held that neither
  is doing-list work; to the extent it is not, the admission stands on the
  orchestrator's waiver under the same delegation. Still out: synthesis,
  pitch and rate, pan, loops, fades and gain automation, effects, a handle to
  one voice, a stop at a future time, compressed formats, sound produced by a
  data module, microphone input, and output on Linux and Windows (LLP 1096
  §7). No tag is added.
- **Expanded (LLP 1098; admitted by the orchestrator under Charlie's
  2026-10-04 delegation, "make decisions without me"):** the media session,
  by the Media Session API's names, on HTML's media element:
  `metadata=MediaMetadata(title=, artist=, album=, artwork=)` on an `audio`
  or `video` claims it; `seekbackward`, `seekforward`, `seekto`,
  `previoustrack`, `nexttrack` and `stop` are that element's events, with
  `MediaSessionActionDetails`; the platform's play and pause act on the
  element; position and playback state are the player's. The web publishes
  through `navigator.mediaSession`, Apple through `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`
  and `MPRemoteCommandCenter` in the video arm; Linux and Windows keep the
  record. On iOS it needs `audio_session: "playback"` and the `audio`
  background mode. Consumers: podcast (F13, Top 5 #1), jukebox (media keys).
  Unblocks media keys, Now Playing, the lock screen and Control Center, a
  headset's buttons and the browser's media hub. Take (offered in LLP 1098
  §9 Q1, accepted): LLP 1042 §5's "Complete-player extension design
  (unimplemented)", a spec with no implementer or date, is deleted, and
  `QUEUE.md`'s "Video (LLP 1042)" lines lose "complete the designed
  track/controller and app audio-session ownership APIs"; to the extent that
  is not doing-list work, the admission stands on the orchestrator's waiver
  under the same delegation. Still out, each until a consumer asks: the
  other actions (`skipad`, slides, calls, picture in picture), Apple's
  scanning, rate, rating and like commands, an app-set `playbackState` or
  position, more than one artwork size, `app:/` artwork, resuming the
  player after an interruption and route policy, MPRIS on Linux and
  Windows's transport controls; and from LLP 1042 §5's deleted design,
  `source` and `track` children, a media controller (play, load, seek,
  fullscreen and PiP requests with results), DRM, and downloads and caches
  (LLP 1098 §7). No tag is added.
- ~~No camera anything.~~ Moved 2026-10-02 (Charlie: "I don't know why camera is so
  aggressively deferred. Can we change that and record the change? It's time to work
  on it"; take waived, none offered): a camera is an app native module in LLP
  1067.000's shape — one object per session holding a preview view and its calls
  (start, stop, capture, flip), gated by the `device.camera` grant (LLP 1069.008), with
  an agent substitute before the OS (LLP 1069.007). Unblocks taking a photo in an
  app, on the web, iOS and macOS first. Not a built-in tag. Video recording and
  barcode or document scanning stay out until a consumer asks.
- ~~No gradient style rows. A gradient with anything on it is a canvas surface with
  children (LLP 1014 §5 — the take for widening `canvas`; the three rows return when a
  host earns them).~~ Moved 2026-09-26 (Seth Webster, for grnl; LLP 1066): one CSS
  `background-image` row, `linear-gradient()` and `radial-gradient()`, painted
  natively on every host and held to Chrome. Unblocks a protection gradient under a
  floating control without a canvas. **Ratified (Charlie, 2026-09-27; take
  waived):** CSS's own row, run natively by the browser and held to Chrome's
  pixels elsewhere; kept as built.
- **CSS visual properties native hosts draw cheaply (Charlie, 2026-10-02: "Waive
  the take"; LLP 1077):** `corner-shape`, `mask-image`, `text-shadow`,
  `box-shadow` lists/`inset`/spread, `conic-gradient()` and stacked
  `background-image` layers, `background-clip: text`, `-webkit-text-stroke`, and
  3D transforms without `preserve-3d`, each CSS's own grammar held to Chrome.
  Unblocks native-looking corners, edge fades and text over imagery without an
  SVG island. Also admitted ("do all of them"), LLP 1077 §5: SF Symbol rendering
  modes, variable values and effects; vibrancy; press haptics; rolling numerals; the
  scroll edge effect; iPad pointer effects; -exact-smart-invert opt-out. Still out:
  `mix-blend-mode` on boxes (LLP 1077 D9).
- No virtualList v2 (cert wires, extent demand, proxy lanes). **Admitted 2026-09-14
  (Charlie: "ok do what you think"):** a straightforward windowed list with bounded
  row/view lifetime and a separate decoded-image budget (LLP 1010 §6). Unblocks
  real Messages histories without constructing every row; memory and construction
  cost trigger it alongside 60 fps. Take: further Messages decorative Tapback/emoji
  artwork, material matching and animation-timing polish move behind list memory.
  O(N) input data is named separately from O(window) UI; recycling is no flat-memory claim.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-27, LLP 1070: "yes delete the old windowed list
  thing, collection list is now better"):** horizontal windowed lists (`display:
  flex; flex-direction: row`) and one level of nesting, a windowed list in a
  windowed list's row, whose lifetime is its outer row's; its scroll position is
  kept by the runner, bounded, as the unvirtualized page would keep it. Unblocks
  the Extra Heavy feed's filmstrip and inbox, and any feed of carousels. Take: the
  legacy windowed list (`item-height`/`estimated-item-height` without
  `virtualized`, `runner/src/instance/window.rs`) is deleted first, before either
  capability lands. Still out: grids, masonry, wrapping and inverted lists; RTL
  row lists; nesting deeper than one level; host keep-alive of an inner list's views.
- No host keep-alive of heavy views by row key, and no reuse of a web view
  or of a native-module view without that module's opt-in (LLP 1068 §4.7,
  §4.8, §5.3; Charlie, 2026-09-27). A reused view is indistinguishable from a
  new element; state that must survive scrolling lives in keyed data.

**Actions** — an action does not call an action (LLP 1017 P4c: a child
reaches its parent through `action` props bound to elements).
**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03: yes to the action-prop tail call):** a
child's action may call one of its `action` props as its last statement (or
the last statement of a last `if`/`match` branch). The compiler puts the named
action's statements there, so it runs last in the same commit (LLP 1017 §P4c,
"The tail call"). The Signal Clone's photo viewer is the consumer: its release
decides to dismiss. Unblocks a child that decides, in its own logic, to tell
its parent. Take: none offered; waived by Charlie's approval.
**Expanded (LLP 1089; waived by the orchestrator under Charlie's 2026-10-04
delegation, "make decisions without me"):** a call anywhere a statement may
stand, to an action of the same component, an `action` prop, or an injected
action, expanded into that commit; a host command keeps its name, and a
call naming both a host command and an action in its component's scope is
refused (`syntax-call-ambiguous`, amended 2026-10-05 with Charlie's approval:
a new host command must never silently rebind an app's call). Consumers:
Files' four copies of "open" (F27) and the spreadsheet's close-the-editor and
move copies (F21); Mail's swipe (F18) is the tail call, once the docs say so.
Take: none offered. Still refused: recursion, a return value, and an action
passed as an argument.

**Motion** — **in v1**, in the LLP 1002 shape: CSS's `transition` model. Targets
are kernel style rows (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `opacity`); a `transition`
row on the node says how they get there; the web host emits it as CSS and does
nothing per frame; every other host runs `exact-motion`, which is held to the
browser by fixtures. One declared deviation, `-exact-spring()`, lowered to keyframes on
the web. Gestures are in as follow-and-release: the platform recognizes, the
engine holds a value and springs it back with the release velocity. The seekable
clock is in, and it is the reason motion is testable: an agent advances time to
`settle_time()` and reads; it never waits.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-05, via the lead: approved LLP 1099's design,
"move to code"):** `-exact-spring()` takes UIKit's parameterisations: duration and
damping ratio, duration and bounce, response, and a labelled `velocity` and an
end time on the physical spring, each lowered to the spring UIKit builds and
cut where Core Animation cuts it. One implementation in `exact-motion`; the
web plays its frames. Unblocks porting UIKit apps' springs by their own
numbers (the Signal clone's menu, reply icon and photo viewer, now
hand-sampled `linear()` curves). Take: the clone's hand-sampled curves are
deleted when stage 1 lands. A take off the doing-list, or a waiver in
Charlie's words, is still to be recorded here. Still out: SwiftUI's own
spring evaluator, vector initial velocities, and per-iOS-version behaviour
(LLP 1099 pins iOS 27.0).

Moved off this list 2026-08-28 (LLP 1002 D6): **delegation to CSS on the web** — it
unblocks a web host that ships zero motion bytes and a parity corpus with the
browser as the oracle, the same shape layout already has. In exchange, not in v1:

- **A gesture arena, claims, leases, compositions, or an interactive-navigation
  model.** Recognition, hit-testing, and scroll-vs-pan arbitration are the
  platform's (`touch-action`, `UIGestureRecognizer`); owning them is the
  permanent bug annuity LLP 0559 F1 describes. Scroll always wins.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-28: approved `panrelease`, with Spark as the
  consumer LLP 1057 asked for):** `panrelease=action`, fired once when a `pan`
  that began ends, with its release velocity (vx, vy) in pan's units per
  second: the platform's where it measures one (UIKit), `VelocityTracker`'s
  elsewhere; a cancelled contact releases at (0, 0) (LLP 1057.001 §6).
  Unblocks throwing what a `pan` drags by state, a card flung off a stack
  (`apps/spark`, admitted with it). Take: none: this is 1057 phase 2's item
  with its consumer. Still no phases, pointer ids or per-frame callbacks.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-10-03: yes to `pointerdown`/`pointerup`):** DOM's
  two events, a touch or the primary button going down on a node and coming
  up (a cancel is an up), with no payload and no recognition. They observe
  beside `press`, `pan` and `contextmenu` and take nothing from them (LLP 1005
  §Events). The Signal Clone's hold-to-record mic is the consumer: recording
  starts the moment the finger lands. Unblocks hold-to-act controls. Take:
  none offered; waived by Charlie's approval. Still no multi-touch.
  **Built (2026-10-04, LLP 1056 §8.6; the widening confirmed by Charlie the
  same day):** stage 3's pointer coordinates, which Canvas 2D's acceptance
  admitted for a canvas's handlers, as a `PointerEvent` record (DOM's
  offset, buttons, pressure, type and id) on these two and a new
  `pointermove`, on any node. The paint app's diary (F1) is the consumer.
  Take: none offered.
  **Expanded (LLP 1094; waived by the orchestrator under Charlie's
  2026-10-04 delegation, "make decisions without me"):** a reorder spanning
  vertical virtualized lists that share a `reorderGroup`, in one session,
  with a host-drawn top-layer ghost, a drop hold, keyboard and
  custom-action moves, the action read `elementFromPoint`, and
  `PointerEvent`'s `clientX`/`clientY`. Consumers: the two kanban builds
  (F4). Unblocks moving cards on a board without a hand-built drag. Take:
  none offered. Still out: reorder on row and nested lists (LLP 1094 §7),
  drags into or out of the app, multi-item drags, grids, a gesture arena.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-29: "Yeah add the every frame task"; take
  waived, none offered; waiver confirmed by Charlie 2026-09-30):** one root task form, `every(frame, action)`
  (LLP 1073): the action once per presented frame, never caught up, and on
  the agent's seekable clock a virtual 60 Hz display. Unblocks a ticker or
  an animation loop in step with the display (the web-framework bench's
  grid ticker). Per-node frame callbacks and frame arguments stay out.
  **Expanded (LLP 1092; waived by the orchestrator under Charlie's
  2026-10-04 delegation, "make decisions without me"):** a gated root task,
  `task NAME when COND [key=EXPR]`, whose timer exists only while its
  condition holds and restarts when its key changes; nothing runs when the
  gate changes. Consumers: ledger2's undo toast, chat's and chat2's bots and
  toasts, trivia's round (their diaries' Top-5). Unblocks an app that does
  no work at rest while nothing is showing. Take: none offered. Still out:
  a reaction to a state change (LLP 1017 P4c's `task … when [dep]`),
  component-scoped and action-started timers, computed intervals, a gate
  that reads `now()`, and cancelling a queued send.
- **A second value graph.** No shared-value plane, derived values, bindings, or
  plan node graph. The style row is the binding.
  **Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-27, LLP 1057.003: "approve those"; take waived, none
  offered):** presentation timelines. A node's keyframes are held at the progress of
  another node's presented value (a drag's translate, a scroll offset), evaluated by
  the engine, with no app code per frame and nothing flowing back into app state;
  paint-only rows in v1. Unblocks derived presentation: a backdrop fading with a
  dismiss drag, a card's rotation with its throw, a header collapsing with its list.
  Every other derived value stays out.
- **General layout transitions.** LLP 1041 §8.12's measured projection admits
  one explicitly registered numeric-height sheet (Charlie’s four-interaction
  campaign, 2026-09-17). Take: other animated layout properties and decorative
  effects wait behind that sheet and its nested collection. This is not a
  general layout-animation system or evidence of physical 120 Hz.
  **Expanded (Charlie, Shop fidelity goal, 2026-09-19):** overlapping product
  accordion heights are admitted for the Shop clone. Their shared layout must
  move following content together when another section is tapped mid-animation.
  Take: other animated layout properties and decorative effects remain behind
  that consumer. The first increment accepts several numeric samples; automatic
  content-height measurement and host adoption remain unfinished.
  **Expanded (Seth Webster, 2026-09-26, for grnl; LLP 1063):** `-exact-layout-transition`
  (a box's laid-out position and surface size, moved by the engine natively and by
  a measured offset on the web) and `-exact-exit-animation` (a removed node stays, out of
  layout, until its keyframes end). Unblocks siblings that slide when content
  around them changes, and things that leave instead of vanishing. **Ruled
  (Charlie, 2026-09-27, "we can try (a) for now"; take waived):** both rows stay
  as declared deviations (LLP 1001). No CSS feature animates a removed node or a
  layout move without snapshots, so the web runs them by FLIP, the technique web
  libraries use; there is no browser oracle for them, and parity is held by one
  recorded timeline compared across hosts. If the emulation's bug rate stays
  high, the fallback is dropping `-exact-layout-transition` and keeping
  `-exact-exit-animation`. Still out: animating any other layout property, and laying
  out per frame.
- **Decay and sequence drivers.** A spring carries release velocity; nothing
  else needs a driver. (`@keyframes` and repeat came off; see below.)
- **Reduced-motion policy in the engine.** The producer emits `transition: none`
  when the host reports the preference, as a stylesheet's media query would.
- **A Core Animation executor for transitions.** Permitted by LLP 1002 D2, not
  built; the Apple lane measures whether it earns its place.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-26: "why wouldn't we just do a complete SVG
implementation here? i think this will be useful and we're using it now"):**
SVG, complete, as the browser renders it, and CSS `@keyframes` / `animation`
(LLP 1055). The first slice (`svg`, `g`, `path`, `polyline`, `polygon`,
`circle`, `line`, `rect`, the SVG 2 presentation properties, animations run by
the browser on the web, by Core Animation on Apple for `opacity`,
`stroke-dashoffset` and `r`, and by `exact-motion` elsewhere) serves the
crypto-list benchmark's charts; the rest of SVG follows as its own stages. Take:
none named; the dead `svgSource` prop is deleted.
  - **Carve-out: `foreignObject` on native hosts** (Charlie, 2026-09-27, LLP
    1055.000 D13 and §8). The web emits it now, with real HTML inside: "our
    general philosophy should be allow platforms to reach their full platform
    rather than sanding everything down to lowest common denominator." Native
    hosts refuse it by name until a design for boxes inside a scene exists;
    the error names the pattern that works everywhere, a box positioned over
    the `svg`.

**Expanded (Charlie, 2026-09-27: "Core Graphics everywhere", by the web's name;
admitted with "seems reasonable"):** the HTML Canvas 2D context on the `canvas`
tag (LLP 1056). A surface in the app's data module, TypeScript or Rust, draws
with `CanvasRenderingContext2D`'s own names and rules. Its recorded calls are
replayed in order by the browser, Core Graphics or tiny-skia into the canvas's
kept bitmap; on Apple a canvas that animates is replayed on the GPU by a module
loaded on demand (vello, its shaders compiled at build time; LLP 1056 §8.5;
Charlie, 2026-09-29: "we're going to want the GPU version of this"). Unblocks computed 2D drawing (charts, sparklines, maps, custom
controls) on every host without a GPU module, with Chrome as the oracle. Take:
Caltrain's line map leaves wgpu. Its `map` surface and shader are deleted, and
it is redrawn as a Canvas 2D surface in Caltrain's data crate, so one fewer GPU
path exists after than before. Still refused: a drawing language in Contract
(SVG is the declarative one), readback (`getImageData`, `toDataURL`,
`toBlob`), `ctx.filter`, and an app-visible `OffscreenCanvas`.
**Expanded (Seth Webster, 2026-09-26, for grnl; LLP 1061–1064):** paint motion
on boxes — `transition` and keyframes on `background-color`, `color`, borders,
`-exact-tint-color` and `box-shadow`, `light-dark()` pairs moving with the appearance —
through the kernel seam and Apple mechanism SVG's colours use (LLP 1055.000 D6);
press feedback (`-exact-press-scale`) and motion at a ProMotion panel's rate; the user's
motion and transparency preferences as `exactViewport` fields, which the app
reads (still no engine policy, above). Unblocks grnl's design as drawn. Take:
the branch's own `path` node, `marker` declaration and block keyframes syntax
were removed at the merge for main's SVG and keyframes; nothing is off main's
list. **Ratified (Charlie, 2026-09-27; take waived):** paint transitions as CSS
names them. `-exact-press-scale` stays as a declared non-CSS host-feedback row (LLP
1001): the press composes through CSS's `scale` property and never writes
`transform`, and it is kept under reduced motion, as a native button's
highlight is (a shrink is feedback, not motion).
- **`runOnJS` and the escape hatch / runtime graph admission** — never existed here.

**Tooling** — no Design Mode, no Guide system, no devtools UI, no blog/CMS. (The
TUI host came off on 2026-10-06: §Surfaces.)

**Agent API** — 10 operations, not 90:

`tree` · `screenshot` · `tap` · `type` · `state` · `layout` · `logs` · `clock` · `prefer` · `perf`

**Ruled (Charlie, 2026-09-27: "relax the rule and allow a 9th button"; LLP 1061
D5, LLP 1069.007 §3 P1):** `prefer` stays as the ninth operation, and it is the
one that sets every device fact by its web name: display preferences, and the
page and place facts of LLP 1069.000. A new fact is a form of `prefer`, never a
tenth operation.

**Ruled (Charlie, 2026-10-02: "it's probably worth a waiver to a 10th op I think";
LLP 1079 D7):** `perf` is the tenth operation and takes none away: a subtree's work
by plan site, and a host's presented frames. A new measurement is a form of `perf`,
never an eleventh operation.

**An eleventh operation replaces one of the ten, same PR.** A new input is a form of
`tap` or `type` (a wheel is a `tap`; so would a drag be); a new question is answered
from `tree`, `state`, or `layout`. The old repo's six primitives grew eighty wire names
one reasonable "view" at a time; the count is the cost. (Charlie, 2026-08-29.)

Not shipping: session record/replay, causal trace, behavior diff and verify, mutation
dry-run, contract witness / dataflow / ~~source-map~~ / bindings, accessibility audit (narrowed below), plan
drag, correlate, visual query, network, perf, pasteboard, onboarding,
revalidate, code grant/resume/cancel. (`perf` shipped as LLP 1079 narrows it: work
counts and presented frames; never a causal trace, a flame chart, a devtools UI or
production telemetry.)

**Narrowed (Charlie, 2026-10-03, waiver: "I guess that trade makes sense ?
idk wdy"; LLP 1080.002):** `tree --ax` reads the platform's own exposed
accessibility tree — Chrome's computed tree, UIKit's and AppKit's
accessibility properties; Linux `unavailable` — and the driver reports four
fixed findings over it: an unnamed interactive element, an element exposed
under a declared-inert or hidden view, an element exposed outside an open
modal, and a role or name disagreeing with the web for a `testId`-joined
fixture control. Still refused: scoring, a rule catalog, WCAG checks
(contrast, target size, heading structure), reading-order claims, and
driving VoiceOver. The guessed `accessibleName` on `tree` is deleted because
the platform's tree supersedes it, not as the take.

Admitted 2026-09-10 (Charlie, LLP 1035 §5; 1035.002 D6, 1035.005 D3): **a
development-only map from plan node to its declaration and component call-site
chain**, emitted by the compiler beside the plan, keyed by the plan's digest, read by
the driver and never by a host, never in a bake. It unblocks jumping from a failing
node to its source. The take: no new Contract syntax until formatting and navigation
have landed (1035.005 §1's order), and `contract` blocks as executable assertions
(LLP 1006 §8) stay off the doing-list. The witness, dataflow and any general
provenance explorer stay refused.

`clock` replaces a `wait` operation on purpose. If the motion graph is closed-form under
a virtual clock, an agent advances time and reads the result; it never sleeps waiting for
an animation to settle. Settle timing is the single largest source of flake in the old
repo's agent loop, and under `RULES.md` a flaky check is worse than no check.

## Process

This half matters more than the feature half.

- **No governance corpus.** 20 docs, capped. No lane manifest, no verify registry with
  675 entries across 64 profiles, no contracts authority map, no issue priority scoring.
- **No speculative specs.** Specifying something you are about to implement is fine and
  expected — the deciding already happened upstream. Specifying something nobody is
  assigned to build is not written at all. The old corpus is 330 RFCs of deliberation
  against 52 specs of conclusion; the new repo imports conclusions.
- **No refine loops.** No dual-family review rounds, no READY verdicts, no revision ledgers.
- **No per-PR ceremony.** No framework decision log, no lane debt ledger, no provenance
  headers on hand-written files.
- **No blocking check the author did not run locally in under a minute.**
- **No 90-minute gate.** If verification takes 90 minutes it runs behind you, or it does
  not run.

## Deliberately worse

- No backwards compatibility, at all, before 1.0.
- No public API stability. Names change. (One exception, LLP 1075.003's hook
  surface: its breaks are deliberate, below.)
- No migration guides.
- Generated files are built, never committed.
- Sparse prose. The code and the checks are the authority.
  **Except the author guides (Charlie, 2026-10-04, LLP 1086 D9):** the guides under
  `docs/` describe the shipped product to the people and agents building with it. A
  change that alters what an author writes or runs updates them in the same change.
  That is not apparatus and needs no approval; a new file there still does.

## Moving something off this list

Write one line naming what it unblocks, and take something off the doing-list in the
same PR. If nothing can come off, Charlie may waive the take in writing; the waiver
is recorded beside the entry, in his words. Without a take or a waiver, the answer
is no. **Restated (Charlie, 2026-09-27):** the take stays the default; the waiver
exists so that an exception is a visible act and not drift.

**Install-page slice, 2026-09-12 (Charlie, LLP 1030.003 D6a/D6b):** bake a
standard `/.exact/install/` page for web/iOS/macOS with configured installation
methods, and let a Mac development server invoke its existing simulator or device
build for a local Simulator or paired phone. Unblocks sharing one honest
installation URL and a local Apple development loop; the generic Go launcher,
distributable IPA, EAS/AppDrop adapter and
automatic provider provisioning remain behind proving this consumer. No new
update service or production native carrier is introduced.

**`--archive --unsigned`, 2026-10-02 (Charlie, waiver):** "Yeah sounds good. Do
1-3" — item 2 of the Signal clone diary's fixes, an ad-hoc `.ipa` with no
identity or profile for a consumer that re-signs it (AppDrop). Unblocks handing
an app to AppDrop without a stub profile; refused for apps with GPU modules,
whose baked digests a re-signer would break. No AppDrop adapter is added; the
distributable IPA and EAS/AppDrop adapter above stay deferred otherwise.
