# What a resource is vs. how it is asked: `with`

**Status:** plan, with a first implementation in progress. 2026-10-01.

## Problem

A native app should paint its first frame from what it last knew. Kept
answers (LLP 1027 D4) exist for exactly this: each store-reading resource's
last fresh answer is saved, and the next launch's first frame shows it until
the data source loads and answers again.

But the runner uses a kept answer only when its arguments equal the
resource's arguments at launch, and in a real app they rarely do:

- **Time is an argument.** TypeScript sources have no ambient clock
  (`Date.now()` is refused by the prelude, by design), so a source that needs
  the time receives it as an argument, e.g. `time.epochAtZero + now()`. That
  value differs on every launch.
- **Re-reading is an argument.** The idiomatic way to re-ask a resource on a
  timer or a pull-to-refresh is to bump a revision argument (`rev + 1`) or a
  timestamp. The last answer of the previous session was asked with
  arguments the next launch never reproduces.
- **Derived context is an argument.** Session expiry, tokens, locale hints
  and similar inputs are passed as arguments because the source needs them,
  not because they identify the answer.

So the kept answer is saved but never shown. The first frame is a
placeholder, and a moment later the same data the device already had
appears: a visible jump on every launch. Apps can't fix this without giving
up time-awareness or revalidation.

The root cause is that one argument list carries two different meanings:

1. **What the answer is.** `status(car)` is that car's status. Yesterday's
   kept answer for it is still the status of that car, possibly out of date.
2. **How it is asked.** A revision, the time, a token or a locale says when
   or how to fetch it. None of them makes the answer a different thing.

Kept answers (and any future cache) should be keyed by the first kind only.

## Proposal

Contract lets a resource separate the two:

```
resource status  = status(car) with rev, time.epochAtZero + now() as shape Status
resource account = session() with sessionRev as shape Account
```

Read aloud: "the status of `car`, asked with this revision and time."

### Semantics

- **The call's own arguments identify the answer.** Everything that decides
  whether a stored answer is the same data goes by these: kept answers today,
  and any later cache.
- **`with` values say how it is asked.** The source receives them after the
  call's arguments, so a TypeScript source's signature is unchanged in shape:
  it just has more parameters. A change to a `with` value asks the same
  question again, exactly as a changed argument does today. Within a session
  nothing about requests changes.
- **At boot, before the source can answer,** a kept answer whose identifying
  arguments equal the resource's current ones is shown. It's stale, and is
  asked again at `data_ready` with the current full arguments. A kept answer
  whose identifying arguments differ (a different car) is not shown, as today.
- **Without `with`,** every argument identifies the answer, which is today's
  behaviour exactly.

### Why a keyword and not an annotation per argument

The split is about the question as a whole: "the status of this car" versus
"asked now, for the third time". Writing it as a clause after the call keeps
the question readable, `status(car)`, and keeps the asking context visibly
apart. It also leaves room to say more about asking later (e.g. `with` values
that never trigger a re-ask) without touching call syntax.

## Implementation

1. **Syntax** (`contract/syntax`):
   - `ResourceDecl` gains `identity: Option<usize>`.
   - The parser accepts `with expr, …` between the call and `as shape`, and
     appends those expressions to `args`.
   - `identity` is the call's own argument count. Span handling lists the new
     field.
2. **Plan** (`plan/tables/format.json`):
   - The `resources` table gains `identity: u16`, the number of leading
     arguments that identify the answer.
   - The builder defaults it to the argument count, and
     `set_resource_identity` sets it for a `with`.
   - The format digest moves. The plan is baked with the app, so no
     compatibility path is needed.
3. **Lowering** (`contract/lower`): sets `identity` from the declaration.
   Type checking and the source-signature table are unchanged, because the
   `with` values are ordinary trailing arguments.
4. **Runner** (`runner/src/runner/settlement.rs`): when the source isn't
   ready, a resource that reads the store and was seeded from a kept answer
   reuses that answer if the kept arguments' first `identity` values equal the
   current ones. It stays stale, so `data_ready` asks again with the current
   arguments. Every other path still compares full arguments.
5. **Web target** (`host/web-js`): it reads the plan field so kept and
   adopted answers follow the same rule. Until then the web keeps today's
   behaviour, which is correct, just without the benefit.
6. **Formatter and editor tooling:** `contract fmt` and the symbols graph keep
   `with` (both work from the AST, which carries the expressions in `args`).
   A formatter round-trip test pins it.

## Tests

- **Parser:**
  - `with` parses one or more values.
  - `identity` is the call's argument count.
  - A resource without `with` has `None`.
- **Lowering:** the plan row's `identity` equals the call's argument count,
  and the full argument count without `with`.
- **Runner:**
  1. A store-reading resource with `with` boots from a kept answer whose
     identifying arguments match but whose `with` values differ: the first
     frame shows the kept value, and `data_ready` asks once with the current
     arguments.
  2. The same with a different identifying argument: the placeholder shows,
     as today.
  3. Without `with`, differing arguments show the placeholder, as today.
- **Formatter:** formatting a file with `with` round-trips it.

## Not in scope

- **A general client cache** keyed by identity. `with` is the vocabulary such
  a cache would need, but this change only applies it to kept answers.
- **Changing what is kept** (the 8 KB bound, which resources are store
  readers).
