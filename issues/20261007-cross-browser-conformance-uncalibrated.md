# Cross-browser conformance has never been calibrated for most apps

**Status:** Open
**Systems:** host/web-js/conform.mjs, host/web-js/conformance/known-firefox.json, host/web-js/conformance/known-webkit.json, scripts/agent-playwright.mjs, scripts/agent-launch.mjs, scripts/async.mjs
**Author:** Claude (Opus 5.5), triaging the async lane's first run on the mini
**Date:** 2026-10-07

The async lane's first full run (M5 mini, main at 931f9fb7d) failed the Firefox step 566 times and the WebKit step 156 times. Chrome is the oracle; the browsers are exactly Playwright 1.63.0's (firefox-1543, webkit-2359), so this is not a version mismatch.

**Why so many.** The Firefox and WebKit steps were added on 2026-10-02 (6a0354e41). The lane last ran on 2026-09-24/25, so they have never had a full run. `known-firefox.json` names differences for 5 apps (caltrain, interaction-gallery, fieldnotes, markdown, realworld). The lane compares 24 apps plus the synthetic fixtures.

**What the failures are.**
- **Most: layout drift that `line-height: normal` permits.** Firefox's rows are 24 px where Chrome's are 22, and the difference accumulates down a list (synthetic-router, synthetic-fields, carousel, markdown-stress, duo-lab, native-fixture, …). These belong in the known lists as the existing entries do.
- **`resources.viewport.pointer`: Chrome `fine`, Firefox and WebKit `coarse`** (weatherlight and others). Headless Firefox and WebKit report a coarse pointer under Playwright. Either launch them with a fine pointer or name it as known.
- **Tree differences that may be real**, each worth a look before it is named known:
  - Firefox, carousel `wheel strip 0 700`: rows in a different order after the wheel;
  - WebKit, video-player `clock +60000`: `0:10` / `-0:00` against `0:00` / `-0:10` (playback time);
  - WebKit, synthetic-startend `tap say`: a virtualized window 400 rows apart (`line-389` against `line-789`).

**To do.** Calibrate each app: name the permitted layout differences, fix or name the pointer, and inspect every tree or state difference before naming it known. Logs: `~/exact2-verify/exact2-async/target/async/931f9fb7de91/conform-{firefox,webkit}.log` on the mini.

## Progress, 2026-10-07 (lane/xbrowser)

Measured on the M5 mini, all 24 apps plus the synthetic fixtures, Playwright 1.63.0:

| | Firefox FAIL lines | WebKit FAIL lines |
|---|---|---|
| The async lane at 931f9fb7d | 15,078 | (not counted per line) |
| After this lane | 1,763 | 925 (507 KNOWN) |

Four causes were in the harness, not in exact2, and are fixed there:

- **Pointer.** The Firefox and WebKit contexts used Playwright's `hasTouch: true`, which makes `(pointer: coarse)` and `(hover: none)` true, while Chrome's oracle reports `fine`. Every app that reads `viewport.pointer` failed every step. Their input is the mouse's in any case; the contexts now have no touch. The touch phases were already refused on this carrier.
- **`line-height: normal`.** Each engine resolves it from its own font metrics. In plain HTML, a 16px system-ui block is 18 px tall in Chrome and WebKit and 20 px in Firefox (20px font: 23 / 23 / 25), so rows drifted 2 px each down every list and moved virtualized windows. In `--browser` mode, both engines now take the same body line height (`body { line-height: 1.2 }`, an adopted sheet in place before any page script; authored line heights still apply), as the agent already hides scrollbars on both. The 912 per-step KNOWN entries that named this drift are removed.
- **Media time.** The frozen media clock (8b02d4c0f) now applies to Firefox and WebKit too, not only Chrome.
- **Wheels.** Firefox's default action scrolls one wheel event at most a page: in plain HTML, a 1000 px wheel moves a 300 px port 270 px, and no pref lifts that in headless Firefox. The steps wheel past a port on purpose (lists.steps). In Firefox the trusted wheel still reaches the page's handlers whole. Its default is taken over by a full-delta scroll on the scroller Chrome would chain to, unless a handler cancelled it. An off-viewport wheel point, which reaches no element in either engine, scrolls the page as Chrome's compositor does. synthetic-lists went from 7,334 to 0, carousel from 338 to 0, and realworld's document scroll now matches.

Blind review of the approach (Astra and Grok, both SOUND WITH CHANGES; folded): no `!important`; the sheet installed before boot; the unused touch pref removed; the media freeze's scope documented; obsolete KNOWN entries pruned.

## What remains, by cause

- **Modifier keys (a carrier bug):** issues/20261007-cross-browser-modifier-keys.md. This is most of the remaining state and tree lines (synthetic-keys, synthetic-tabindex).
- **Native controls' intrinsic sizes (user-agent; candidates for per-node KNOWN, as markdown's file input already is):**
  - text inputs and selects: synthetic-rem `size`, synthetic-budget `in-*`, synthetic-mounted `pick`;
  - textareas: synthetic-keys `area` and `grid`, where Firefox's rows are taller;
  - file inputs: markdown `open-file` on steps other than boot, Firefox 194 against Chrome 164;
  - checkboxes and radios: synthetic-early and synthetic-controls, where Chrome stretches a checkbox's box across a stretching column (365 px) and WebKit keeps 12 px; synthetic-radios, 2–3 px.

  Each such entry should name the node and the followers it moves, with the plain-HTML evidence.
- **Text metrics (glyph advances and rounding):** small drift, at most 1.6–3.3 px, in synthetic-text, synthetic-styles, synthetic-failed, synthetic-blur, native-fixture, typetour and completion-storm. Larger wrap-driven differences in markdown-stress and textflow (the same text breaks lines differently), and realworld's favourite link, which follows the ♥ glyph's fallback width (5.7 px). In plain HTML, the same 16px system-ui string is 67.28 px wide in Firefox and 67 px in Chrome. Not yet named KNOWN: the decision is whether to name them per node or to give cross-browser layout a text-metric tolerance.
- **Viewport segments:** Firefox and WebKit have no Viewport Segments API (Chromium's), so synthetic-segments' `prefer segments` steps differ in state, tree and layout. This is a candidate KNOWN class for that fixture's segment steps.
- **Unclassified, to look at:**
  - Firefox grants `requestFullscreen` in headless mode (video-player's viewport becomes 1366 wide); Chrome's does not.
  - WebKit marks the root and a disabled view focused after Tab (synthetic-tabindex).
  - WebKit's media session readback is `playing` or `paused` where Chrome's is `none` (video-player, synthetic-media).
  - `mediasession episode seekforward` finds no box for view 2 in both engines.
  - weatherlight's live forecast changed between the Chrome and WebKit pages (05:15 against 05:30), because the fixture reads a live API.
