//! The kernel→motion seam: a commit, restated as what the engine needs to hear.
//!
//! @ref LLP 1002 §3 (the frame); LLP 1003 §4 (the seam)
//!
//! Motion's inputs are style. After a commit, the animatable rows of every
//! node the commit created or touched are the engine's new targets, each
//! node's `transition` row is how it gets there, and its `animation` row is
//! what plays over them — exactly what a browser reads from computed style. Nothing else crosses: no bindings, no
//! shared values, no second graph. A destroyed node is forgotten. Numeric
//! height is a separate, explicitly registered host trial: the ordinary seam
//! and boot targets remain the four compositor properties.
//!
//! The engine keys nodes by a number the host chooses; here it is the
//! generation-checked [`NodeKey`] packed into a `u64` ([`motion_node`]), so a
//! reused slot never inherits its predecessor's motion.
//!
//! Colour is its own pass ([`Kernel::paint_sync`], LLP 1062 D2): a native
//! host reports appearance to [`PaintMotion`], which resolves `light-dark()`
//! and keeps the record of which nodes own paint motion. [`LayoutMotion`]
//! observes boxes after layout; the hosts only present the resulting values.
