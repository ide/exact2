//! Named timeline lookup (LLP 1057.003 D4; Scroll-driven Animations 1 §4.2).
//!
//! A named timeline is referenceable by the node that declares it and its
//! descendants; `timeline-scope: <name>` on a node declares the name in
//! scope for its subtree, attached to the one descendant that declares it
//! and is not already captured by a nearer `timeline-scope`, or else to an
//! inactive timeline; `all` does that for every name below it. So a
//! consumer's lookup walks up from itself, and the first node that declares
//! the name or scopes it decides; nothing found is no timeline. Chrome 154
//! agrees case by case (the phase 3 probe), `all` aside: it parses none.
//!
//! The kernel keeps a registry of the few nodes that bear a timeline row
//! (sources, consumers, scopes), kept from each commit's receipt, and after
//! a commit re-resolves every consumer; the receipt names those whose
//! answer changed, and `motion_sync` sends them (`MotionSync::timelines`).
