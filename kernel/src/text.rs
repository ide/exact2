//! Text measurement: the one structural text IR and the injected measurer.
//!
//! The kernel never embeds platform text APIs. A host supplies a
//! [`TextMeasurer`] per kernel — there is no process-global callback — and the
//! kernel hands it a paragraph as ordered [`TextRun`]s with the offer it must
//! fit. A `Text` node with its own `text` prop is one run; otherwise its `Text`
//! children are its runs, flattened in order. The same runs feed measurement,
//! export, and (later) selection: one traversal, per-consumer projections.
//!
//! [`MonospaceMeasurer`] is the deterministic reference measurer used by tests
//! and headless hosts.
