# Messages

The canonical Exact2 Messages test app. The older Snapback-backed app is preserved in
[`../messages-legacy`](../messages-legacy/README.md), with separate package names and
`com.exact.messages.legacy` app identity.

This is an Exact Contract/TypeScript port of
[Expo's chat-demo](https://github.com/expo/react-native/tree/chat-demo/packages/chat-demo)
at `da3b4d6ad3d6a4ac9fa95fb2efd9a532bdf0544e`. Its `ui-metrics.md`, Composer,
ChatScreen, and native balloon-path implementation supply the measurements. The
reference's MIT license is in `assets/reference-LICENSE.txt`.

Run from the repository root in two terminals:

```sh
bun apps/messages/service.ts
bun host/web/dev.mjs --app messages --port 8767
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8767. Native builds use the same local AI service:

```sh
bun host/apple/build.mjs --ios messages-apple --run
bun host/apple/build.mjs messages-apple --run
```

The service reads `~/Dropbox/APIKeys/openrouter.txt`. `OPENROUTER_KEY_FILE` or
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` can override it. The key stays in the Bun process; it is never
baked into the app or sent to the browser. The service listens on loopback port
4318 and admits browser origins on local development ports 8765–8768. This setup
supports the browser, Mac, and iOS simulator; a physical phone requires a separate
reachable, authenticated transport.

The initial **Chat** conversation is the reference's Ada/Lovelace fixture. The other
threads connect to different models. Compose creates a new model conversation;
tapping a model name switches the model for that thread. Model search fetches
OpenRouter's live text-model catalog. The local service streams OpenRouter responses
and the app polls cumulative snapshots every 250 ms, preserving text through native
answer cancellation. Stop, retry, failure messages, independent conversation context,
and persisted drafts/transcripts/reactions are implemented. Native data lives in
`app:/data/messages.json`; the browser uses Exact's local storage implementation.

The transcript uses the reference's 17/20-point typography, 14/10-point balloon
insets, 280.667-point portrait width limit, 6.65-point fitted tail, run grouping,
receipts, typing pulse, resisted timestamp drag, swipe-to-reply, message menus and
long-text reader. The growing composer uses its measured field/button insets.
Send motion uses the reference's spring coefficients, delay, and squash timing.
The demo's Add menu can receive messages, append fifty rows, toggle typing, or reset.
Light/dark colors and reduced-motion settings follow the host.

Validation: `bun test ./apps/messages/app.test.ts` covers persistence, grouping,
context isolation, cumulative streaming, retry, and cancellation. App drives have
exercised browser and simulator layouts and real Gemini/GPT responses. Exact's
`scripts/agent.mjs --app messages` targets this app through the standard driver.

Fidelity limits: this is a source-measured port, not a completed pixel-diff
certification against the running Expo app. Wrapped balloons currently use CSS
shrink-to-fit rather than Expo's custom longest-line fitting. The Add card and
message menu use Exact glass; the Add card does not reproduce UIKit's keyboard-
overlapping popover. Send uses a uniform squash rather than independently deforming
width and height, and tail changes are immediate. The transcript is eager, so the
reference's 100,000-row performance is not claimed. Native keyboard and physical-
device gesture parity need a direct reference recording.
