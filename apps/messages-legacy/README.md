# Messages

An in-progress iPhone chat example in Exact2. The view is `app.contract`;
`app.ts` owns the shared conversation model. Messages now persists people,
messages, drafts, reactions, muted/blocked state, contacts and recoverable deletions
through Snapback4. Apple and Linux use the reusable native device; the browser
runs the same Rust device as the published Wasm artifact over Exact SQLite.
The baked conversation fixtures still provide the first frame without app code.

Conversation answers contain at most 200 messages, centered on an opaque `order:id` cursor
(empty means latest). Long histories show explicit **Show earlier messages** /
**Show later messages** rows and **Show latest messages**. Each shift starts at
the top of its new window; latest and sending return to the end. History does
not follow arrivals: non-empty cursors keep their start as arrivals append,
even in a partial window near the tail. The eager transcript retains up to 200 mounted messages,
without preserving position across shifts; its scrollbar spans that window.
Short fixture threads keep their existing presentation. The scroll policy passes
on web; the headless Linux drive still ignores the authored end request
(pre-existing at `ccc5367`, tracked in `QUEUE.md`), so Linux latest/send
positioning is not verified.

Per-thread indexes bound transcript reads to a binary search, the window and
its two neighbors. Selection uses only selected IDs (sorted by order in O(S log S));
the reply sheet still returns all R rows of its indexed root, including its own
receipt. Thus an open reply chain can still cost O(N) when R=N.

Durable sources declare the records they can change. Drafts, unread/mute/block state
and reactions compare only their selected records; no full-history snapshot or
held-map copy occurs on those saves. Changed values are detached before storage
awaits and installed only after admission. Omitted keys remain unchanged; explicit
nulls delete records. Unknown durable sources refuse before mutation. Tests compare
every durable source against the complete model and actual device, including a
negative control that deliberately omits a write.

Sources known not to alter reply scheduling also skip copying the pending-reply
map before persistence. Sends, blocks, conversation deletion and reply ticks keep
their full rollback copy, as do future sources by default. Failed saves restore
reply order and the previous clock; the ordinary full-model rollback still prunes
invalid schedules. Two native Hermes comparisons, each with eight alternating
pairs, measured 5,000 pending conversations created through real sends. Drafts
fell from 0.55 to 0.34–0.37 ms, reactions from 0.43–0.45 to 0.23–0.26 ms, and unread
changes from 0.64–0.65 to 0.43–0.46 ms. Ten pending conversations were roughly flat;
Bun/Wasm gains were smaller and mixed. This removes work proportional to pending
conversations from these saves, not from reply ticks or the whole application.

Person positions remain stable across prepends/appends, so sends and contact edits
include only their affected people. Imported numeric positions are retained; if an
extreme finite value prevents insertion, positions rebase in the same atomic edit,
still subject to the 512-record cap.

Recovery operations now capture only selected messages and expiry candidates,
including expired rows in other conversations. They no longer serialize/compare
unrelated archived payloads. Failed admission restores both expiry and the selected
change; the 512-record limit still refuses oversized expiry or purge atomically.

Some costs remain: people lookup scales with contacts, and deletion/recovery still
scan recoverable row metadata for expiry. Receipt transitions use a derived set of outgoing messages still
awaiting Read; insertion, recovery and restore rebuild it, while marking a receipt
clears it. The persistence footprint captures those rows before the handler runs. Thread removal still rebuilds
its indexes. Startup, changed sync and exceptional rollback still restore the whole
model. The 512-record edit cap still refuses oversized edits atomically
(LLP 1027.004 D5; tracked in `QUEUE.md`).

The 300 ms reply timer skips snapshot/diff work when no receipt or generated reply
changes the model revision. It still updates the local clock; real changes keep the
existing persistence and rollback path. This check applies only to reply ticks:
reading recently deleted messages can expire durable rows without a revision change.

An idle sync no longer rereads or compares the history. Reset/adoption, applied
changes, snapshot catch-up and outbox settlement mark reconciliation as owed;
failed reads or model publication leave that flag set for the next tick. Status
and queued counts still update, and changed syncs still reread the full history.
On the browser, small metadata-only device commits first compare their final values
with SQLite. Unchanged metadata skips persistence; actual changes still commit the
original batch. This avoids whole-database exports on idle sync. The comparison adds
one read to actual small metadata writes; data-bearing and large commits bypass it.

The development connection is explicit in `snapback-client.ts`: origin
`http://127.0.0.1:4400`, persona `alice`. Each origin/viewer partition has its own
app-scoped database and stable device identity. Start the Messages backend locally
with `bun run --bun snapback4 dev` from `apps/messages-legacy` (the source is `snapback/schema.q`).
The build compiles that schema for a fresh device that starts offline. The footer
shows whether changes are saved locally, waiting to sync, synced, or refused.
A separate three-second source checks the server through normal grant-checked
fetch; network waits do not block local edits. Receipts stay in the durable
outbox until their server data arrives; snapshots replace predictions. Each edit groups up to 512 related
records in one mutation; a refusal cannot commit just its preview or draft change.
New devices seed fixtures only
when those rows are absent, so opening another device preserves existing edits.
This development backend shares one persona's local conversation collection;
phone numbers do not connect to SMS or iMessage.

The existing UI behavior stays in TypeScript, including the clock-driven example
replies. Selection, scroll commands and simulated typing remain session state.
All persisted records contain authored model data, without derived bubble geometry.
Snapback4 is pinned to **0.2.30**, published from source commit
`a397218e2332964ebe29aa1d30918c436713cc8a` (root README setup).
Bake copies the package's Wasm and generated bindings; the Wasm loads from the
app's immutable assets after first pixel. Each drained device write commits in
one SQLite transaction; a disk refusal reloads the durable device image.
Before initial acquisition, queued record edits render as pending local content.
The browser device uses a new SQLite table; old TypeScript-replica tables remain
on disk but are not imported. Native partitions retain their existing data.

After baking Messages, `bun test apps/messages-legacy/snapback.test.ts` exercises the
published device and real CLI server, including offline reopen and lost receipts.

Run from the Exact2 root:

```sh
bun host/apple/build.mjs --ios messages-legacy-apple --run
bun host/web/dev.mjs --app messages-legacy
```

Drive the installed simulator app:

```sh
bun scripts/agent.mjs --app messages-legacy ios 'tap conversation-maya' \
  'type composer See you soon!' 'tap send' state
```

`--sim <UDID>` on the build and `EXACT_SIM=<UDID>` on the driver select a
simulator. Native TypeScript execution needs the matching lean Hermes archives
described in LLP 1027's iOS execution section, which the iOS build provisions
into `~/.cache/exact/hermes/<pin>-lean-ios`; simulator archives must be thin
archives for the build architecture, not universal Mach-O containers. The build now
invalidates a previously cached iOS engine-less stub when archives are provisioned.

Current behavior: searchable fixture conversations, native iOS controller navigation,
native multiline text editing with a growing composer, per-conversation drafts,
local sending, a dedicated recipient/compose sheet, focused inline reply threads, anchored Tapbacks with a scrollable reaction palette,
message deletion, a contact page, and an emoji attachment tray. Safe areas and the keyboard-resizing viewport use the normal Exact2 host. The module test exercises real baked Hermes bytecode and verifies conversation isolation.
Add and its emoji choices now retain the current editor: six physical iPhone cases and a browser comparison preserve the draft and keyboard, without focusing an idle composer (`/tmp/messages-attachment-menu/focus-corrected.json`, `web-focus.json`). An ordinary launch also preserves the focused composer and its frame through physical Add open/close (`ordinary/native-ordinary-r2.xcresult`); the initial button-category lookup failed before tapping and is not evidence.
The native reference instead opens a 320 × 456.6-point scrollable popover, including over the focused keyboard. Three temporary public-UIKit prototypes do not establish that presentation: the ordinary popover moves above the keyboard; adjusted margins produce the right box but leave it behind the keyboard; a separate-window probe still moves it above. No popover implementation lands from this stopped loop (`/tmp/messages-attachment-menu/probe/`, LLP 1021 D2).

The inbox starts with a large, left-aligned title and a Compose button beside bottom search,
following [Apple’s iOS 26 guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/send-and-reply-to-messages-iph82fb73ba3/ios).
On the iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 capture, the large title's measured ink bounds match
the native reference: x=18–175.67 and y=128–157.67 points. Scrolling fades it into
a centered compact title over the list. UIKit now permits vertical elastic
scrolling even when the inbox fits; held drags, reversal and release work with
both six fixture threads and a single search result. Browser wheel input at a
short viewport exercises the same title state and restores it at the top.
Navigation preserves the title/search geometry and conversation draft. This is
not yet the complete native title transition: the recorded native list travels
farther for the same drag, and its soft header edge differs from the current
uniform material. The initial large-title placement is verified independently
of those remaining motion/compositing differences.
A standalone UIKit comparison isolated that travel difference: an 80-point
drag moved a standard large-title table about 62 points while its top inset
collapsed from 168 to 116; a bare scroll view moved 36.67 points, the same as
Exact, regardless of whether its content size filled the viewport. Both returned
to their initial position on release. This points to navigation-bar ownership,
not a different generic scroll resistance. A separate public scroll-edge fixture
produced the soft edge with a native label; a custom-painted text view did not.
Those mechanisms are not yet integrated into the app's header.
Native containment now installs before child geometry; a refit requested during
that batch waits for completion, and an initially selected sheet waits for first draw.
Separate presenting/sheet owners keep focus through installation and presentation;
keyboard/Back and two-session reload/destruction pass (`/tmp/messages-owner-install/`).
Public XCTest verifies Back cancel/complete and sheet cancel/dismiss/resistance
(`/tmp/messages-xctouch/`). The production batch preserves natural content extent;
iOS/macOS growth, shrink and resize checks pass (`/tmp/messages-content-extent/`).
The temporary semantic-header projection removes the short-list gap and its third
candidate passes isolated long-list collapse/expansion and held sheet cancellation.
It still fails authored scroll assignments: requesting 80 reports 132; requesting
zero reports -52. The same Contract reports the requested values in the browser.
This three-round prototype is stopped (`/tmp/messages-header-origin/`, LLP 1035.001
D9); general header geometry, native title integration and arbitrary reversal remain open.
A left swipe on an inbox row reveals purple Hide Alerts and red Delete circles,
measured against the installed iOS 26.5 Messages. Mute/Unmute closes that row
and keeps its history; the muted marker appears beside its title. Deleting a
fixture thread removes it from the inbox, clears its saved draft and cancels its
pending reply. Its contact remains available, and a new send starts fresh history.
Browser touch input and actual Simulator drags/taps exercise these actions,
vertical scrolling through the nested horizontal rows, and fresh composition.
The inbox uses 45-point avatars and an 86⅔-point row pitch. Its first row starts
at y=168, correcting the earlier eight-point excess below the large title. A
fixed 20⅓-point heading row prevents the taller text chevron from pushing the
preview down or squeezing a two-line preview. The first sender's ink starts at
y=184⅔, matching the captured reference; the first preview starts within one
captured pixel in that capture. The kernel now preserves fractional frames,
including the row pitch, nested offsets and subpixel updates. A shared geometry
fixture previously lost a quarter-point inset and turned a half-point edit into
a whole-point move; its iPhone result now matches the browser within the driver's
two-decimal reporting precision. Apple text measurement now also preserves explicitly authored fractional
line-box heights, including empty, multiline and clamped text. Intrinsic widths,
normal line heights and painted baselines still round independently. A native-label/CoreText/WebKit comparison found no universal
baseline adjustment, so exact glyph placement remains a separate target. Padded paragraphs now wrap and paint inside their content box: quoted replies keep the declared gap beside their border, and empty-result labels honor their top padding. The iOS/browser drives and AppKit selection regressions are in `/tmp/messages-text-padding/verification.json`; this does not establish exact native text rasterization. Long quotes now show their missing ellipsis at the two-line limit; the shared text fix retains selection offsets and adds nothing when all text fits (`/tmp/messages-line-clamp/verification.json`).
The fractional line-height repair passes the Swift host regressions and an isolated
iPhone action-dispatch flow covering two-line previews, stable rows, local send,
compose cancellation, retained drafts, reactions and timestamp centers. Caltrain’s
full iOS smoke also passes with its reference image unchanged. Physical
gesture revalidation for this repair remains pending: the shared Simulator was
in concurrent use during the attempted sweep.
The controls use authored icon paths. A revealed row has the reference's gray
rounded background. Swiping another row closes the previous one; resetting a
row clears its highlight. Tapping a row while actions are revealed dismisses
them first; search and new composition also close them. Browser touch and physical Simulator gestures verify
switching rows, acting on them and vertical scrolling. The app observes the
standard `scroll` event; the hosts retain ownership of the gesture and offsets.
A right swipe now reveals a 50-point blue Read/Unread control in a 70-point
leading area, measured against native Messages (including its #0088ff color).
It toggles only that conversation's unread state, keeping drafts, history,
Tapbacks and pending replies. Opening the conversation marks it read again.
The browser touch drive covers both action sides, switching rows, cancellation,
read/unread, draft retention, search, mute and delete. Scroll tracking now lives
in the view; the data module no longer stores per-row scroll-reset revisions.
The earlier physical leading-action investigation stopped after three rounds:
agent activation worked while desktop-pointer taps appeared to miss. A later
reaction investigation reproduced a browser covering the Simulator, establishing
that a Simulator screenshot alone does not prove input reached it.

**Read/Unread physical revalidation (2026-09-10).** With the named Simulator
raised and verified foreground before every input, actual right drags and taps
now pass both Mark as Read and Mark as Unread. Each closes the row to its
70-point resting offset without opening the conversation. A held drag reversed
before release leaves unread state unchanged; switching to another row closes
the first; the group row's Read action works. Mark as Unread preserves the draft,
all other inbox entries and the full message history; opening the conversation
marks it read and restores that draft. A fresh ordinary launch without agent
flags also passes both directions: the unread dot disappears and returns while
the row closes. No runtime change was needed for these results. This closes the
currently reproducible leading-action failure; it does not establish where each
older failed input landed. Captures, state snapshots and source hashes are under
`/tmp/messages-leading-foreground/verification.json`.
At that stage, full-swipe commit remained unfinished; the explicit native binding
below now handles leading full swipes. recovery styling, symbol details
and exact reveal/close animation remain unfinished.
`scrollLeft` closes an acted-on row through the normal post-layout property path;
a browser/iPhone fixture verifies both axes, clamping after content growth,
independent resets and unrelated updates preserving manual scrolling.

**Full-swipe surface comparison (2026-09-10).** A foreground-guarded native
Messages drag from x=110 through displacements 60, 130, 210 and 260 points
keeps Read/Unread pending while held and commits on release. Reversing through
130 back to zero before release cancels. Both full-swipe directions of the
read/unread toggle were observed, restoring the reference conversation's read
state afterward. The first attempted capture entered drag-to-pin instead:
checking the window between touch-down and the first move delayed movement.
The corrected helper posts touch-down and the initial drag in one process,
starting movement after 16 ms. The drag-to-pin capture is excluded from the
swipe evidence.

A standalone public `UITableViewController` with `UIContextualAction` and
[`performsFirstActionWithFullSwipe`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiswipeactionsconfiguration/performsfirstactionwithfullswipe)
reproduces the action's capsule widths at those held points: 87, 165 and 200
points for the 130, 210 and 260-point drags, matching the native reference.
Its roughly 50-point height differs by at most one captured pixel in those
samples. Callback records show zero actions after reversal and exactly one
per full release; a state snapshot at the last held point still has the
previous action count. This verifies the standard surface and its action
boundary, not complete pixel parity: the fixture uses default cell content,
and its initial unread symbol name did not resolve, leaving an empty capsule.

At the time of that study, Exact, driven through the same path in an ordinary
launch, kept a 50-point circle and left the row open without toggling on release.
The subsequent integration target was a native row presentation using UIKit's swipe
actions while preserving the kernel's row dimensions and logical node identity.
A callback must invoke the existing authored action once; reversal must not
invoke it; vertical list scrolling, row switching, draft retention, accessible
actions and the browser's controls must remain usable. No native row projection
landed from that study alone; the subsequent binding is recorded below. Captures, the temporary fixture and callback
snapshots are indexed in `/tmp/messages-full-swipe/verification.json`.

**Native row integration experiment (2026-09-10).** A private iOS build now
hosts the real Exact inbox buttons inside single-row UIKit tables. The existing
parent scroll view retains vertical scrolling; the kernel still supplies the
row width and height. Before each batch, row views return to their logical
parents for the ordinary update, then remount in their cells. The native action
captures the authored control's icon and invokes that same control's live id;
it does not call the data module directly or infer a read/unread mutation.
Physical full swipes pass Read and Unread, reversal cancels, and the original
row press still opens its conversation. Draft and complete history survive
Back and another full swipe. Row switching closes the previous cell's actions;
the first tap on an exposed row dismisses its actions without opening it.
An overflowing inbox with the search keyboard open scrolls vertically by 70
points. A short inbox moves while held and returns to zero; the first test's
assertion that it should retain a positive offset was incorrect, and the saved
held frame plus the overflowing case establish that the parent receives input.
An ordinary launch also completes full-swipe Read. Its resting inbox crop
(y=168–795 points) differs from the preceding ordinary production capture by
0.000029 mean RGB levels.

This is an experiment, not a supported host binding: it is gated by
`EXACT_NATIVE_SWIPE_PROTOTYPE=1` in the private package, temporarily locates the
fixture by test ids, and implements only the leading action. None of that
lookup code is in the repository. A production boundary must explicitly bind
content and action identities, handle trailing actions and removal during a
native transition, expose accessible action names and native action inspection,
and retain the authored fallback on other hosts. The private source, build,
physical checks and captures are in `/tmp/messages-native-row-integration/`.

The explicit-binding candidate was stopped on 2026-09-10 at its bounded repair
limit and removed from the working tree. Its compiler roundtrip and browser
fallback passed; its final iOS build installed. On the pinned Simulator, a real
right drag exposed the native Read button, and inspection found its 50×50-point
frame at (10, 186), its accessible name, and its registered primary activation
event. Both agent activation and a foreground-guarded physical tap then left
Maya unread. The cause is not established; this does not invalidate the earlier
body-only prototype's recorded full-swipe result. The candidate also moved the
whole authored wrapper subtree to preserve ancestry, so its callback/containment
path needs an isolated explanation before another production attempt. Trailing
actions and deletion were not reached. An initial run used a different booted
Simulator than the physical input and screenshot; its assertion is excluded.
The final pinned runs, source recovery patch and browser evidence are preserved
in `/tmp/messages-native-swipe-binding/`. At that stop, production retained its
authored swipe strip. After restoration, a rebuilt
iOS app passed physical Read/Unread with state assertions, then an ordinary
launch repeated the cycle: the unread dot disappeared and returned, and each
action closed the row. That recovery preceded the following isolated diagnosis.

**Explicit native swipe binding (2026-09-10).** A private callback trace found
why the candidate rejected the action: UIKit sets its `UITableViewCell` to
`isUserInteractionEnabled=false` during the native callback, and Exact's guard
incorrectly treated that projected cell as an authored input restriction. The
host now captures each action's original ancestors before projection and tests
those, preserving hidden/disabled/inert restrictions and the original scroll
visibility. Reset releases the projections. The ordinary source uses explicit
`swipeContent`, `swipeLeading`, `swipeTrailing` ids and `destructive`;
there is no test-id lookup or diagnostic tracing in the host.

The production build passes physical full Read and Unread, reversal without a
state change, partial action taps, native Mute/Unmute, and Delete while UIKit
completes the action. Driver activation of a revealed native action also passes
and reports `host-activation`; inspection reports its actual frames and accessible
name. Original row presses, drafts and full history survive navigation and
reparenting. Switching rows closes the prior actions; the first body tap closes
an exposed row without opening it. A short inbox bounces back; with the search
keyboard open, the overflowing parent scroll advances 67.33 points. The browser
keeps the authored controls and passes Read/Unread, Mute, draft retention and
Delete. Evidence is in `/tmp/messages-swipe-activation/`.

This closes the missing native leading full-swipe behavior, not the whole inbox
parity gap. Trailing full-swipe confirmation, recovery styling/filter coverage, exact
symbol artwork and all native transition timings still need comparison. The
initial binding captured the first-child icon with untransformed bounds; the
scale correction is recorded below. Input tests still use a temporary
foreground-guarded Simulator pointer helper. A separate fixture verifies that
hidden actions, disabled actions and actions under a disabled authored ancestor
stay unavailable, then become physically activatable when the restriction clears.
An ordinary launch also completes full Read/Unread in light and dark appearance;
the dot is absent after Read and present after Unread, with the row closed.
That fixture uses reported screen coordinates: viewport coordinates alone missed
its safe-area offset. Its first counter also conflated body presses with actions;
the final fixture separates them. The three sampled full-Read capsule widths are
within 0.67 points of the saved native Read captures at the same displacements;
this is sampled shape evidence, not proof of the entire transition curve.
All five repository checks pass for this binding; the workspace test run took
552.97 seconds and ran asynchronously. The combined checks exceeded the shared
blocking time budget on this run; the timing is recorded, not claimed compliant.

**Inspection during a held native gesture (2026-09-10).** Apple agent requests
now run in common run-loop modes. Previously a compose-sheet drag prevented even
`layout` from answering until finger release: the request crossed a one-second
probe deadline and returned after release at 1.22 seconds. With common modes,
layout, state, native editor inspection and driver screenshots all answer while
the contact stays down. The `compose-header` has a named driver target.

The fixture maps the Simulator's `iOSContentGroup` accessibility frame to the
reported iPhone screen coordinates; it has no window-chrome or sheet offsets.
With the software keyboard visibly open, a 200-point downward path moves the
header from screen y=62 to y=232, while the modal's keyboard inset changes from
308 to 478. Reversing restores both positions and native first-responder status;
the existing conversation's saved draft survives. The same test passes with the
Simulator window at (20,55) and (180,65), then restores the window and hardware
keyboard setting. Reads of geometry/state/editor status complete in milliseconds;
the driver screenshot completes within 100 ms in the sampled runs. The initial
hardware-keyboard run is retained separately and is not software-keyboard proof.
A first attempt to show the software keyboard through Toggle Software Keyboard
left the inset at zero and was excluded; the verified fixtures disconnect the
hardware keyboard temporarily and check the 308-point inset before dragging.

This is a native-inspection repair, not a shipped Simulator input backend: real
contact delivery still uses the temporary guarded pointer helper, while the
existing driver's iOS contact phases still report unsupported. Full driver-owned
contact cleanup and backend selection remain LLP 1035.003 work. Captures,
request timings and source versions are in `/tmp/messages-held-inspection/`.
The native Messages reference was also relaunched: its pin placeholder cleared,
but the simulator then showed blank previews and 12/31/00 dates. That fresh
fixture is not evidence for a normal inbox or a reason to copy those omissions.

**Conversation-deletion confirmation study (2026-09-10).** Native Messages on
our iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 simulator asks before deletion for both a revealed trash
button and a completed full left swipe. The conversation remains until a second
Delete; tapping outside dismisses the confirmation and closes the row. The card
says “This conversation will be deleted.” above Delete, has no separate visible
Cancel, and sits over the expanded action. Both native requests were cancelled;
no native conversation was deleted. The full-swipe reference is
`native-full-corrected-released.png` in `/tmp/messages-thread-deletion/`; the
first full-swipe attempt used the old row position after the header collapsed
and is excluded. The native card was also captured across a dark appearance
change while open.

A standalone public-UIKit fixture defers the `UIContextualAction` completion
until an `UIAlertController(.actionSheet)` resolves. Outside dismissal invokes
its cancel action, leaves the commit counter at zero, and closes the swipe row.
A subsequent physical Delete in the fixture increments its commit counter exactly
once; that fixture only counts, and does not delete native Messages data.
It reproduces the wording and standard controls, but both `sourceView/sourceRect`
and `sourceItem` leave a pointer and different positioning from Messages. A third
candidate allowing overlap and suppressing the arrow did not build: its geometry
logging used the obsolete `NSStringFromCGRect` spelling. The shell then installed
the preceding binary, so the `overlap-*` captures are explicitly **not** evidence
for that candidate. This loop stopped at three rounds; no confirmation UI or new
Contract property was added to the app. Swipe Delete now moves a conversation
into Recently Deleted immediately; its eventual confirmation still needs retained
swipe completion, stale-target handling and the unresolved native anchoring.
Recently Deleted now offers local recovery and permanent deletion through the existing menu/confirmation mechanisms, following [Apple’s iOS 26 guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/recover-deleted-messages-iph16ecebf48/ios).
Deleted records retain message order, reactions and reply identity for 30 fixture-clock days; new activity does not erase that history. Selection deletion preserves the active draft. The ten baked-data tests pass after deletion callers gained the explicit clock argument.
Browser/iOS activation passes recovery, cancellation and purge. Ordinary native touches reach recovery, but returning to Messages fails with a loading filter menu; the native flow remains unverified (`/tmp/messages-recovery/`).
Recover action styling, filter-menu coverage, recovery-screen visual verification, agent-mode menu presentation and native motion remain unfinished. This screen was compared with Apple’s guide images, not a live native recovery capture.

**Native swipe glyph sizing (2026-09-10).** The host now includes the first
child’s own scale/rotation when rasterizing its icon for UIKit. A bare layer
render omitted that transform: Mute’s white ink was 23.67×25.33 points and
Delete’s 22×26, although both were authored at scale 0.75. The corrected sampled
ink is 17.67×18.33 and 16×18.67 points respectively. Native’s sampled shapes are
16.67×18 and 16.67×19.33; the size defect is repaired, but the authored paths
still differ from native symbols.

The app’s action backgrounds now match the pinned iOS 26.5 capture: Mute is
`#6155f5` in light appearance and `#6d7cff` in dark; Delete is `#ff383c` and
`#ff4245`. Freshly revealed actions use the correct palette. No native reference
conversation was deleted or sent a message during this comparison.

An already-open action still retains its earlier appearance. Two bounded
adaptive-capture attempts made its image and background switch correctly but
corrupted unrelated avatar lettering or repainting in saved screenshots. Both
were removed at the repair limit; neither live UIKit trait overrides nor a
render-only palette override remains in production. Passing action state tests
was insufficient evidence for those attempts. The verified transform correction
and app colors remain; captures and the rejected sources are preserved in
`/tmp/messages-swipe-glyphs/` for an isolated rendering diagnosis.
After removal, the unaffected inbox rows match the previous verified light-mode
capture exactly (zero mean RGB difference). A separate ordinary-launch control
uses the prior, unscaled host with the same app palette: reveal and close in
light appearance, switch to dark, then reveal again. Its surrounding rows are
pixel-identical to the scaled host (screen y=255–795 points), including all four
lettered avatars. The earlier visual suspicion about that ordinary dark capture
is not evidence of a scale-induced repaint defect. The adaptive experiments
remain removed; this control does not establish their failure mechanism.
A separate native fixture measures 24×12
points for a plain rectangle, 18×9 with scale 0.75, and 9×18 with that scale and
90-degree rotation; every action activates. The rebuilt browser fallback and
all five repository checks pass; the workspace test run took 195.66 seconds.
The post-control rebuild and six-case native binding drive pass too. Its final
ordinary light/dark reveals match the native background RGB values and retain
pixel-identical surrounding rows against the control. The first ordinary-launch
drag missed; the following body tap opened the conversation. Those captures are
excluded, and the successful repeat checked each revealed surface before the
next step. Input delivery for that first miss remains unexplained. Full evidence:
`/tmp/messages-swipe-glyphs/verification.json`.

New Message opens a dedicated sheet with a To field, close control, fixture
recipient results and a separate draft. Selecting a recipient enables the
composer; adding or removing recipients keeps that draft. The To field remains
editable and wraps selected names. Results exclude already-selected people.
Sending to one person reuses their conversation; multiple people create a local
group on the first nonblank send. Selecting the same members in a different order
reuses that group, including the Weekend fixture. Sending clears its unread state
and starts the offline reply sequence with an attributed group sender.
Cancel leaves inbox search and existing conversation drafts alone; a new compose
session starts empty. MobileSMS on iOS 26.5 immediately dismissed an unsent
one-character draft without a confirmation and reopened empty. Browser and
physical Simulator close taps verify cancellation with an empty sheet, recipient
query, one recipient and multiple recipients: no thread is created, an existing
conversation draft survives, and reopening clears the recipient query, selection
and new draft. The iPhone drive also verifies keyboard dismissal and closed inbox
rows after each cancellation. The Apple presenters now preserve scroll positions
while the inbox is hidden; previously closing compose revealed every row’s leading
action. Browser/iOS/macOS fixtures verify the underlying hide/restore behavior.
New rows created by sending from the sheet also start with their swipe actions
closed. The iOS presenter now defers their scroll assignments with the source
route's geometry; applying the offset against a new row's zero-width content
had discarded it. The browser/iOS inbox drive checks the actual 70-point
offset and saved pixels after sending, receiving, deleting and reopening.
The empty sheet was compared with MobileSMS on the iPhone 17 simulator running
iOS 26.5. Physical taps also verify open/close, recipient choice, a keyboard keystroke, sending, and
retained composer focus after the conversation opens.
Baked-module and browser/iOS drives cover duplicate exclusion, five-recipient
wrapping, removal without draft loss, cancellation without creating a thread,
whitespace-only send rejection, group reuse and preservation of one-to-one history.
Physical Simulator taps also add, remove and re-add recipients, retain a real
keyboard keystroke, and send to a new group with the keyboard still open. Group
titles truncate within the header; initial avatars remain placeholders.
Tapping a recipient now selects it; Backspace removes the selection. At an
empty To cursor, Backspace selects the last recipient before a second press
removes it. Escape or focusing the message clears the selection. Ordinary query
text still deletes normally, and removing every recipient keeps the draft.
Browser, iOS agent and actual Simulator keyboard taps verify these paths.
The native reference also selects recipient text before keyboard deletion.
The UIKit field now forwards software-keyboard Backspace, including on empty
text. A separate browser/physical-iPhone fixture verifies one key event before
normal deletion, emoji deletion, empty-field events and ancestor delivery. That
comparison also fixed the browser driver selecting all text before a key press;
key presses now preserve the existing cursor/selection.
Typing now replaces a selected recipient while preserving other recipients and the draft; browser and physical iPhone keyboard drives verify first/last replacement, ordinary deletion, two-stage Backspace and cancellation (`/tmp/messages-recipient-replacement/`). Native software-keyboard capture confirms replacement and retained To focus.
Token editing remains approximate: selection handles, caret movement between
names and selection while a query is present remain unfinished. Native contact
picker and sheet presentation/dismissal motion still need implementation/comparison.
Phone numbers and email addresses can now be entered directly, as in
[Apple’s documented compose flow](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/iphone/iph82fb73ba3/ios).
Return or focusing the composer commits a recognized address or exact contact name.
Direct Send includes a valid typed address with the selected recipients; unresolved
text keeps Send unavailable and remains editable with the draft intact. Common US
number spellings and email case differences reuse the same local recipient, and
selection/cancellation creates no conversation. Baked-module tests and browser/physical
Simulator drives cover these paths, including software-keyboard Return and keeping
an unfinished recipient from being silently omitted. New address avatars use an
authored person silhouette; its exact native geometry remains a comparison item.
These addresses use the example’s
offline iMessage behavior, without an account or carrier lookup. Exact invalid-address
tokens/errors, international formatting and service-dependent colors remain unfinished;
MobileSMS’s malformed recipient labels on this simulator limit that visual comparison.
The recipient field declares `autocapitalize="none" autocorrect="off" spellcheck="false"`,
so names start in lowercase without automatic correction or spelling checks.
Disabling spelling checking removes UIKit’s empty 27-point prediction strip:
the built app’s recipient keyboard is now 308 points high, with its top edge at
screen y=566 matching native Messages on this iPhone 17/iOS 26.5 simulator.
The setting uses HTML’s spelling-check hint and logical-ancestor inheritance;
keyboard height remains platform behavior. Physical software-keyboard touches
verify lowercase entry before and after sheet drag/reversal, and dismissal returns
to the full-height inbox. The forwarding/navigation drive also verifies the
308-point overlap, retained source draft, blocked source Back, and subsequent Back
cancellation/completion. Choosing a recipient restores normal sentence entry in the
composer. Browser and physical iPhone drives cover selection/cancellation/sending
and live input hints; host/kernel tests cover spelling overrides, ancestor changes,
reparenting and clearing to defaults. Existing history appears after sending, not
during recipient selection.

Message bubbles open Tapbacks through UIKit long-press and double-tap recognizers;
the web uses `contextmenu` and `dblclick`. A single bubble tap is inert and retains
composer focus. Physical Simulator long-press and double-tap drives verify both
recognizers in the main conversation and focused replies; the agent's
`tap bubble-m1 contextmenu` / `tap bubble-m1 dblclick` forms inject the recognized
iOS event and do not themselves prove finger recognition. The corresponding
browser forms use actual secondary/double mouse input.

The Tapback preview aligns with its source bubble and the complete panel stays
inside the safe viewport above the keyboard. The rest of the conversation is
dimmed; the selected balloon and its receipt stop painting while their preview
is visible, retaining layout and identity. Tapping outside dismisses the panel.
Scrolling the suggested emoji and
selecting a later choice works on iOS and web. Double-tap shows only reactions
and retains the keyboard, including outside dismissal. Long-press adds Reply
and More below the preview and focuses the action menu, hiding the
keyboard. Dismissal and reaction selection restore composer focus if
it was active before the long-press; a closed keyboard stays closed. Both paths
preserve the draft, and selecting the same reaction again removes it. Browser
and physical Simulator drives verify these distinctions and focused-reply
behavior. The keyboard split follows captures of the local simulated Messages
fixture, including keyboard restoration after a long-press reaction. Normal-mode
Simulator captures also show double-tap keyboard retention and long-press
dismissal restoring an unsent draft and keyboard. The earlier far-right miss
at (390, 170) is not reproduced by twelve current physical entry/dismissal pairs
or eight ordinary-launch pairs: light/dark, both entry modes, prior focus, and
existing reaction badges pass (`/tmp/messages-outside-dismiss/verification.json`).

The palette and action card use the existing iOS glass material. The strip is
64 points high with 49-point choice spacing and 11/16-point outer insets,
measured from the native fixture. The preview keeps the transcript’s original
16-point inset and group indentation. Paired native captures now establish
long-press dimming as #16152a at 21% opacity in both appearances; double-tap uses
black at about 10% in light and 50% in dark. This is measured dimming, not full glass
parity. The six standard reactions now use bundled resting artwork in the palette, badges and participant bubbles, retaining their saved values; other choices remain emoji. The selected choice uses a 44-point circle with sampled native light/dark fills #26aeff/#0065d3 inside contiguous 49×64-point hit cells. Browser/iOS replacement/removal, unchanged artwork frames and six physical edge/gap taps pass (`/tmp/messages-selected-tapback/verification.json`). The populated native reference is Simulator 4453C3E4-C3B2-4D3F-A961-21E7AAB88780; Exact runs separately on 49090EC4-F5C2-4CD0-A6AB-F661D027F64B. The existing native reaction was inspected without changing it.
The reference images are Apple artwork from iOS 26.5 (23F77) ChatKit: final frames `heart_108`, `thumbsup_073`, `thumbsdown_069`, `haha-ENG_114`, `exclamation_103`, `question_080`, exported at 3× for this local UI study. The app loads six ordinary PNG assets (51,622 bytes), with no runtime framework lookup.
`/tmp/messages-reaction-artwork/verification.json` records native light-reference comparisons, browser/iOS replacement/removal and light/dark captures, and 11 physical incoming/outgoing/group reaction, badge and outside taps with drafts and the other participant's reaction retained. An ordinary launch without a development asset override displays the bundled artwork; public XCTest selects HAHA, opens the shared participant view and dismisses it at (390, 170), without isolating the earlier outside miss. After alignment, opaque glyph RGB error falls from 30–113 to 1–9 levels; this excludes background, placement and animation parity.
Browser and physical iPhone checks cover preview geometry, scrolling to later emoji and focus restoration. Normal-mode captures cover light and dark materials. The dimming repair passes twelve browser/iOS mode captures and seven physical selection/outside cases, retaining the draft, other participant’s reaction and editor focus; incoming/outgoing native pixel pairs and the one-level residual channel difference are in `/tmp/messages-tapback-compositing/verification.json`. A public UIKit backdrop comparison preserves regular glass: a tint, underlay or ultra-thin substitution does not improve both appearances. Stock-menu and cross-Simulator evidence, plus the stopped Exact fixture comparison and its missing viewport-fit setting, are in `/tmp/messages-glass-palette/verification.json`; complete action-card backdrop parity remains open.

This remains a custom approximation: the remaining native actions (including
Translate), reaction-participant presentation, stickers,
animated reaction artwork, compositing, haptics, final preview pixel rounding/clipping,
and presentation animation remain unfinished. Native double-tap also dims the
system keyboard; this app’s dimming layer ends above it. A public non-key-window probe at normal + 1, status-bar and alert levels does not reproduce the keyboard dimming; editor focus survives, but touch interception is unmeasured (`/tmp/messages-keyboard-dimming/verification.json`). The selected fill matches
the sampled native dark color; complete palette compositing remains unmatched.

The native emoji-picker study (`/tmp/messages-emoji-picker/`) establishes a
public platform input path, now integrated through `emojiPicker=true`. A public `UITextField`
overriding [UIKit's `textInputMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/textinputmode)
to the active emoji mode opens the system grid with Search Emoji. On the same
iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 Simulator its keyboard frame is (0, 486, 402, 388),
matching the native picker's vertical extent. Physical input searched `coffee`,
selected `☕️`, reopened the picker and cancelled it; the selection callback
received only the emoji, not the search text, and the separate draft remained
unchanged. The public field still shows ABC and dictation controls that the
native reaction grid omits. A second variant using only `UIView + UIKeyInput`
loses search (keyboard top 539, height 335) and retains those extra controls;
it is not the replacement. UIKit documents that an overridden input mode still
allows the user to change keyboards.

Native captures also establish the presentation's state transitions. Opening
the attached smile button replaces the strip and action card with the keyboard,
raises the selected balloon, and exposes a larger smile control with Close.
Close returns to the reaction strip **without** the action card, while keeping
the conversation dimmed; it does not dismiss the entire presentation. Searching
and selecting coffee instead closes the presentation and adds the reaction.
`native-close-outcome.png` records the actual Close action; the earlier
`native-picker-cancelled.png` does not, because backgrounding Messages had
already dismissed the picker.

The integration (`/tmp/messages-emoji-integration/`, 2026-09-09) separates entry
focus/dimming from the visible strip/actions/picker state. The small smile
control sits 6 points beside the enlarged balloon, on its inner edge, with its
center 10 points below the preview top. Zero-height side slots preserve the
balloon's width basis; the host projects their horizontal position alongside
the preview. Opening replaces the strip/actions with the native keyboard and
larger smile control plus Close. The app retains its draft independently.

Browser and iOS driver runs verify outgoing/incoming placement, invalid-text
refusal, skin-tone/ZWJ selection, Close and Escape, prior-focus restoration,
focused replies with a flag, and a group message with a keycap. Physical
Simulator touches separately verify long-press opening, the small smile hit,
software-keyboard entry of `coffee`, selection of ☕️, incoming double-tap
opening/Close, and outgoing long-press opening/Close. Search text never became
a reaction or changed the draft. Hardware keystrokes did not populate the
search in this integrated drive; the successful search used software key taps.
Double-entry Close restores QWERTY while retaining the strip; long-entry Close
retains the dimmed strip with keyboard and action card closed. The native
keyboard frame is (0, 486, 402, 388) on this fixture.

Remaining: joined thought-bubble/glass artwork and its dots, native picker
animation, exact keyboard controls, stickers, native incoming large-control
geometry (currently mirrored from outgoing), and final participant-popover
placement/artwork. Per-person ownership and grouping are implemented below. The custom circles are functional approximations. Web/macOS
filter emoji character entry but do not automatically open an OS picker;
Linux explicitly reports this selection policy unsupported. The single-grapheme
filter is bounded and is not a complete Unicode emoji-sequence validator.

An ordinary launch separately verifies picker selection, draft/QWERTY
restoration, a subsequent physical standard reaction and continued software
keyboard typing (`ordinary-*.png`). A second ordinary launch types `dog` into
Search Emoji through software key taps: the results change to dogs, paws and a
bone; selecting the dog-face result adds 🐶 and closes the keyboard when the
composer was not previously editing (`ordinary-search-dog.png`,
`ordinary-dog-selected.png`). This proves filtering independently of the
frequently used coffee result. The longer reply-to-reaction driver sequence subsequently exposed a separate
input-carrier defect, now repaired (`/tmp/messages-focus-driver/`). A minimal
case is sufficient: type a draft, double-tap a balloon, choose a standard
reaction. The app's focus slot and `layout <composer>` both showed the editor
losing focus. The driver walked beyond the pressed reaction button to the
menu's key handler and made that ancestor first responder; the native pressed
button consumes its touch instead. The driver now stops its responder walk
at the resolved press target. The existing Insets fixture reproduces the old
failure with a retained button beneath a key handler, and verifies the repair
using UIKit's actual first-responder state. Explicit focus-taking controls,
editor taps and blank-ground blur also pass. The original longer sequence now
passes in full, including draft/focus restoration and all receipt/preview cases.
This driver repair passed its first candidate; the earlier picker implementation
used three product fix rounds.
The five workspace checks pass after the driver repair (build 13.0 s, tests
166.7 s with all failures collected, clippy 18.5 s, formatting 1.8 s,
caps/boot 0.1 s each). The targeted Insets smoke passes on iOS and web.
`/tmp/messages-focus-driver/verification.json` records the before/after
first-responder observations, the longer Messages sequence, checks and matching
installed/source build identities. The picker integration's earlier captures
and macOS build remain in `/tmp/messages-emoji-integration/`.

A further offline native comparison establishes that reactions belong to
people, not message direction. The settled captures in
`/tmp/messages-reaction-ownership/` cover an outgoing own reaction, an incoming
other reaction, own-plus-other reactions with different and identical emoji,
a long-press with two participants, and removal of only the local reaction.
Native renders mine blue and the other person's gray; identical emoji produce
two separate badges. The participant popover groups identical values under one
symbol with overlapping avatars. Removing mine preserves the other person's.
Measured badge boxes are 36 points, centered about 3 points inside the balloon's
inner edge and 10 points above its top, with 27-point spacing. The popover uses
98-point group spacing, 32-point avatars overlapping by 14 points, and
124/214-point widths for one/two groups.

An app candidate implemented that per-person model, grouped participants and
zero-width sibling badge slots in both transcripts. Browser and iOS driver
checks passed anchors, unchanged balloon dimensions, addition/replacement/removal,
emoji selection, group messages, focused-thread reopening and draft/focus.
An iOS verifier failure caused by targeting the menu with Escape was isolated:
that input explicitly focuses the menu. Dismissal through an outside physical
touch passed the same sequence. The browser receipt/preview regression also
passed against the candidate.

The candidate was initially reverted after physical badge misses despite
passing activation checks. The follow-up in `/tmp/messages-touch-phases/`
changed the evidence: a reduced overflowing-badge fixture receives complete
UIKit touch sequences; the full candidate does too. A reproduced miss generated
no application- or window-level touch event, and a simultaneous desktop capture
shows a browser covering the Simulator. The coordinate helper was clicking that
browser, while the Simulator-only screenshot still showed Messages. Adding a
post-release delay did not fix those misses. Window placement alone is not proof
that the intended desktop surface receives the input.

**The unchanged candidate is restored.** The physical verifier raises the named
Simulator window, checks that Simulator is frontmost, reads its placement, and
then converts the app coordinates. The traced candidate and a clean build with
all tracing removed pass repeated outgoing/incoming/focused badge taps, another
person's badge, independent local add/remove, and group reactions. Draft and
UIKit first-responder state stay intact during badge use. Prior untraced misses
cannot all be attributed retrospectively, but they no longer establish a badge
layout defect. The clean proof is `clean-physical-results.json` and `clean.log`;
the local Message source is identical to the previously saved candidate. No
native hit-testing or touch-handling change was needed.

The implementation stores reactions per person, derives the two transcript
views from that map, and highlights only the current user's selection. The
fixture seeds Maya's heart on m7. Zero-width slots beside each balloon attach the
badges without changing its percentage width basis; swipe-to-reply remains on
the balloon. The participant popover groups identical emoji under one symbol
with overlapping avatars. The later placement repair below separates it from
the palette with the keyboard open. Standard glyphs now share the bundled resting artwork; flat blue, dots, glass,
transitions and badge travel during reply drags are not exact native matches.
The physical Close control on the focused thread blurs the composer; its native
reference policy still needs comparison. The passing badge-focus claim does not
cover that Close action.
The final repository build passes the same physical sequence, plus web/iOS
ownership and receipt/preview regressions. An existing module-test file now
checks that changing or removing the local Tapback preserves Maya's reaction in
both transcript views, including same-emoji participant grouping. That targeted
test passes. All five workspace checks pass (build 37.0 s, tests 314.2 s with all
failures collected, clippy 19.2 s, formatting 1.8 s, caps/boot 0.1 s each).
`/tmp/messages-touch-phases/verification.json` records the source and binary
identities and the valid/invalid diagnostic runs separately.
An ordinary launch also passes physical opening of Maya's existing reaction,
adding the local heart beside it, opening the shared-symbol/two-avatar popover,
and outside dismissal (`ordinary-*.png` in the same directory). The app is left
running with both badges visible.

**Participant/menu separation (2026-09-09).** Fresh, foreground-verified native
captures on Exact Date Headings (iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5) show the participant
popover at y=62, height 122, and a crowded palette at y=208: a 24-point gap.
Opening the emoji picker keeps the preview in place and replaces the palette
with the taller attached control. Native also moves the transcript behind the
preview downward in the crowded case; that part remains owed in Exact.
`/tmp/messages-panel-placement/native-{upper-keyboard,crowded-badge,crowded-picker}.png`
holds the reference, using the existing offline KB conversation and a local
heart on its “After ten minutes” message.

Messages now authors a separate menu region below the participant popover.
Apple and web context placement intersect the region with the safe viewport.
The ordinary palette reserves 146 points below the safe-area top (122 + 24);
the picker's 88-point placeholder reserves 122, keeping the preview at the
same lower bound when it replaces the 64-point palette. Messages without
reactions reserve no participant space. The region's blank area dismisses the
menu while retaining the editor; its controls keep their own actions.
The first candidate's no-reaction branch used a dynamic `"0px"`, which the
style bridge refused and poisoned the runner on a newly created conversation.
The second candidate uses the supported zero percentage. This was a style-value
failure, not evidence of a message-loop identity defect.
The corrected candidate passes foreground-verified physical badge, picker,
Close, reaction and outside-dismiss taps on iOS, including two participants
and focused replies. The crowded iOS palette is y=208 and the preview y=278;
the picker keeps the preview y=278. A 402×480 browser viewport exercises the
same lower bound with a zero safe-area inset (palette y=146, preview y=216).
Web/iOS regressions also pass receipt anchoring, action spacing with and without
receipts, unclamped and bottom-clamped previews, new conversations, groups,
focused replies, and draft/focus restoration. The ordinary iOS launch repeats
the crowded badge → picker → Close → outside-dismiss sequence with the keyboard
visible throughout. `native-ordinary-*.png` in the evidence directory are
**Exact** captures; `native-crowded-*.png` are MobileSMS. The Swift package's
21 host tests pass; the initial private-package test attempt lacked its copied
test directory and did not run tests. `verification.json` records the final
source/binary identities, gate results and known remaining gaps.
All five workspace checks pass for this repair: build 26.8 s, tests 401.0 s
with all failures collected, clippy 90.1 s, formatting 1.8 s, caps/boot 0.1 s
each. These full-suite timings exceed the blocking-loop budget and are recorded
as observations, not a claim that the speed budget is met.
The same reference also separates two preview modes that Exact currently
conflates. OCR bounds for “After ten minutes” are about 131.9 points wide in
the transcript, 133.2 after a badge tap, and 152.2 after long press
(`native-*.ocr.json` in the evidence directory). This is evidence that badge entry
keeps the original text scale while long press magnifies it, rather than
evidence for magnifying every entry. A follow-up on the outgoing JA counterpart
confirms it: text width 131.9 in the transcript and after badge entry, 152.2
after long press (`native-outgoing-{transcript,badge,long}.{png,ocr.json}`).
At that point Exact still magnified both entry modes. The native focused-thread
case remains unmeasured; the overlap repair preserved the prior shared scale
policy, which the next repair replaces.

**Preview entry modes (2026-09-09).** `contextMagnify` is a boolean host policy
beside `contextTarget`, declared once in the kernel schema. False keeps scale 1;
absence or true keeps the existing 15% enlargement, capped at 26 added points
of width. Both modes share source-edge alignment, participant-region clamping,
side-control placement and receipt positioning. It does not change authored
CSS transforms or kernel frames. Messages binds it to the original entry's
`selectedActions`, so opening/closing the emoji picker preserves that entry's
mode even while the action card is temporarily hidden.

`/tmp/messages-preview-modes/native-outgoing-double.png` confirms a real double
tap on the native message body uses the same unscaled presentation as badge
entry. Foreground-verified physical iOS badge taps, double taps, long presses,
picker/Close and outside-dismiss taps now pass for outgoing and incoming
messages. The outgoing source/preview widths are 242/242 for badge and double
tap, 242/268 for long press; the incoming widths are 111/111 and 111/127.65.
The focused-reply controls implement those modes too, but that is an Exact
behavior check, not a recovered native focused-thread comparison. The browser
passes the same mode, geometry and draft tests. Its initial run exposed a
missing DOM mapping for the new prop; the mapping and an existing host-policy
regression now cover explicit false and subsequent true. The compiler regression
round-trips the plan and switches the same preview false → true → false through
the distinct input handlers. A first test build needed the concrete runner
data-source type on its closure; the corrected test passes.
The web/iOS receipt and action-spacing regression also passes in both modes,
including new conversations, groups, bottom clamping and focused replies.
The final ordinary launch repeats badge, double-tap and long-press entry
(`native-ordinary-*.png` in this evidence directory are **Exact**, not
MobileSMS). OCR text widths for the same outgoing message are approximately
214.3 in the transcript, 215.6 after badge/double entry and 238.4 after long
press; the geometric checks above are the more precise scale measurements.
That sequence also exposes an anchoring gap: the ordinary transcript text is
at y≈254 before long press, but the enlarged preview text is at y≈575 after
the keyboard closes. Native's outgoing reference keeps its text around y≈298
across that keyboard change (`/tmp/messages-panel-placement/native-outgoing-*.png`).
This exposed source retention and surrounding-transcript displacement as the
next repair (below). A receipt staying aligned with Exact's newly laid-out
source is not proof of native entry anchoring. Transition animation, reaction
artwork and glass remain separate fidelity gaps.
All five workspace checks pass for the entry-mode repair: build 33.8 s, tests
494.3 s with all failures collected, clippy 78.5 s, formatting 1.8 s, caps/boot
0.1 s each. These are observed full-run times, not a claim that the blocking
speed budget is met. `/tmp/messages-preview-modes/verification.json` records
the final sources, installed binary, runtime evidence and remaining gaps.

**Preview source anchoring (2026-09-09).** iOS and web now capture the source
before the entry batch can change keyboard focus. A height change retains its
position; a width change recaptures it. The surrounding transcript receives the
same presentation displacement as the retained, clamped preview. A centered
reply scroller also retains its clip position, so translating its contents does
not cut off neighboring messages when the keyboard closes. Closing the menu
removes both projections; normal scroll layout and the draft return.

The native comparison is the existing outgoing MobileSMS reference in
`/tmp/messages-panel-placement/native-outgoing-*.png`, and the crowded incoming
reference there. The first iOS candidate retained the source but clipped a
neighbor in a multi-message focused thread; the second retains the scroll clip
as well. The browser's first candidate could be displaced by ResizeObserver's
later end-follow adjustment; projection now follows that adjustment too.
Physical iOS entry tests measure an unclamped incoming source at y=290.67 before
and after keyboard dismissal. A crowded outgoing source and its neighbor move
by 37.33 points for badge entry and 39.48 for long press, together with their
preview. Repeated badge, double-tap and long-press entry, clock updates, picker
round trips and dismissal retain the draft and restore the original transcript
offset. A multi-message focused thread retains both source and clip positions.
Browser viewport expansion/contraction passes the same presentation checks;
width changes recapture the anchor, and dismissal clears every projection.
The compact 402×480 browser run also passes crowded-menu and picker checks.
The first resize test incorrectly required an unchanged DOM scroll offset while
the viewport height changed; it now checks retained painted positions during
resize and the original offset after restoration. These focused-thread checks
verify Exact's behavior; native focused-thread parity is still unmeasured.
An ordinary iOS launch (without the agent clock) now keeps the incoming
"Perfect" text at y≈302 versus y≈304 before enlargement. The crowded outgoing
text moves from y≈254 to y≈291, instead of the previous y≈575 after keyboard
dismissal. Both dismissals restore three sampled transcript text rows within
0.2 points by OCR, with the keyboard visible again. Those `ordinary-*.png`
captures are Exact, not MobileSMS. The final iOS build and physical checks,
browser checks, and all five workspace checks pass: build 45.2 s, tests 316.1 s,
clippy 42.5 s, formatting 1.8 s, caps/boot 0.1 s each. These full-run timings do
not establish compliance with the blocking speed budget.
Artifacts and source hashes are in `/tmp/messages-context-anchor/verification.json`.
Preview animation, native
artwork, glass, final clipping/pixel rounding and the other gaps below remain.

**Participant popover shadow (2026-09-10).** The rounded glass surface now owns
an inner scrolling row instead of also serving as the content clip. This is an
app hierarchy change: the same material, radius, panel dimensions and group
geometry remain. It removes the sharp rectangular cutoff around the glass's
shadow. On the one-group panel, mean adjacent-pixel RGB steps along the sampled
left/top corner boundaries fall from 4.9/4.37 to 0.1/0.1; the existing native
crowded-badge reference measures 0.1/0.067 there. This checks the cutoff, not
overall glass or pixel parity. `corner-steps.json` in
`/tmp/messages-popover-shadow/` records the samples. Apple documents the effect's
composition constraints in [UIVisualEffectView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivisualeffectview/);
no effect subclass or host clipping rule changed for this repair.

Physical iOS and browser checks pass badge, double-tap and long-press entry,
picker return, source anchoring and draft retention. The two-group panel remains
214×122 with 32-point avatars 98 points apart; light/dark changes, both owners'
badge entry and removing only the current user's reaction preserve those
invariants. The ordinary launch also shows the smooth shadow and retains the
keyboard through badge entry and dismissal. All five workspace checks passed; full timings are in the evidence below.
Build, runtime, pixel evidence and source hashes are under
`/tmp/messages-popover-shadow/verification.json`.

**Copy and action rows (2026-09-10).** Copy now writes the complete selected
message through `copyText(selectedBody)`, closes the menu and restores the
composer only when it was editing before entry. It does not change the draft,
send a message, or read the clipboard. UIKit and AppKit use their general
pasteboard; the web starts its Clipboard API write during input dispatch and
logs denied/unavailable writes. Linux explicitly reports unsupported.

The native reference's Copy action writes exactly `After ten minutes` and
restores its retained `Picker draft` and keyboard. Physical Exact Copy taps
pass for outgoing, incoming emoji, focused replies, twelve lines containing
`café 👩🏽‍💻` (beyond the preview's eight-line clamp), and entry without a focused
composer. Each check reads the destination clipboard after the tap and verifies
the entire string, menu dismissal, draft retention and prior focus state.
The browser passes the same cases; clipboard-read permission is granted only
after the first copy for inspection, not to trigger the write.

The menu keeps its 250-point width, leading icon slots, 42-point action rows
and ten-point top/bottom padding. Reply, Copy, Select and More make its height
188 points; direct Translate, Reply artwork and exact glyph rasterization remain owed. Native Translate first offers message/conversation scope, then opens the system half-height sheet; a public adapter matches its six measured controls and handles expansion/dismissal. Exact’s existing Select → native edit-menu Translate preserves the same editor and draft through Close and permits subsequent composer editing. First-use consent was cancelled; translated results and the direct-action integration remain open (`/tmp/messages-translation/verification.json`, LLP 1035.001 D4). The measured
17-point Copy label matches the reference's 38⅓ × 15⅓-point dark ink.

**Text selection (2026-09-10).** Select dismisses Tapbacks, restores the source
bubble and selects its full text in a read-only editor. The retained text node
keeps the bubble's layout; UIKit supplies draggable handles and Copy/Look Up/
Translate. Actual simulator touches shorten an outgoing selection and Copy
writes precisely `I’m in. Meet y`; outside dismissal retains the unsent draft.
Web/iOS drives cover multiline Unicode, focused replies, groups and draft isolation.
Browser selection uses the DOM's `select()`; Apple uses native `selectAll`. Both defer selection until the editor is mounted. Parent Tapback/reply gestures yield to the editor. Outgoing selection now requests white through inherited CSS `caret-color`; incoming keeps the system tint. Light/dark web/iPhone captures and physical handle/Copy/dismissal checks verify it (`/tmp/messages-selection-tint/`). Exact
selected-text rasterization and the return animation remain. Transcript and Tapback text preserve newlines with CSS `pre-wrap`, keeping selection and preview line breaks consistent. Browser/iOS drives cover empty lines, focused replies, reactions and retained drafts (`/tmp/messages-preview-newlines/`). The iPhone selection editor now respects the bubble's 20-point line spacing; UIKit probes cover fractional spacing, reset, selection/Copy and typing; physical handle dragging and Copy preserve the selected newlines (`/tmp/messages-selection-lineheight/`).
Reference/public UIKit probes, ordinary-launch selection/Copy, and integrated captures are under `/tmp/messages-text-selection/`. A current-build regression had disconnected `selectText` in the shared session dispatcher: Select created an editor without selection handles. The dispatch is restored and held by a batch-to-editor Swift test plus public XCTest long press, range shortening, outgoing/incoming Copy and dismissal with the draft retained (`/tmp/messages-selection-geometry/`). The current 17/20-point specimen has no measured glyph shift through selection; the return motion and broader native raster comparison remain open.

An ordinary iOS launch, without agent flags, also passes a foreground-guarded
long press and Copy tap. The pasteboard contains exactly `I’m in. Meet you there
at 10?`; the keyboard returns, and the transcript crop from y=160 through 470
points is pixel-identical before entry and after Copy. All five workspace checks passed; their timings are in the linked evidence.
All 21 Swift tests pass; AppKit's clipboard branch compiles but has not been driven through a macOS Copy interaction. Browser success is exercised; the permission-denial path is implemented but not yet driven. Source hashes, logs and captures are indexed in `/tmp/messages-copy-action/verification.json`.

Named inbox buttons now retain their declared names and activation through the native swipe-cell projection. Ordinary accessibility snapshots expose all six conversations; public accessibility activation opens the intended thread, refuses a filtered-out retained cell, and activates its replacement. Eight physical swipe cases pass; full VoiceOver behavior remains unverified (`/tmp/messages-swipe-accessibility/verification.json`).
More enters message selection with the pressed message already checked. The
composer stays mounted with its draft while the selection toolbar replaces it;
incoming bubbles move 40⅔ points, and outgoing bubbles retain their width and
right edge. Tapping a message or its circle toggles selection. Trash is disabled
at zero selections and opens the native reference’s lower-left glass confirmation
with “Delete Message” or “Delete N Messages”. Tapping outside cancels confirmation;
the top-right X exits selection. Selected-message Delete now declares an HTML modal dialog, projected through ExactKit’s native confirmation owner, with no `confirmDelete` slot or authored cancellation overlay. The rebuilt iPhone action matches native (26,766,208,48) for one/two messages in light/dark; physical cancellation and deletion pass. Browser outside dismissal preserves selection, first Escape closes confirmation, and second Escape exits selection. The two-session dialog fixture passes editor retention, reload, unmount and destruction. Native Close/Forward dimming, browser visual polish and motion parity remain open (LLP 1021 D2; `/tmp/messages-modal-confirmation/`). Three standalone UIKit variants do not reproduce the dimming through native tint, configuration updates or disabled appearance; no production dimming change follows (`/tmp/messages-confirmation-dimming/`, LLP 1035.004 D6). Both cancellation and confirmed deletion leave
the keyboard closed, as observed in the native selection capture. Bulk deletion
updates the inbox preview, including empty history. Browser and physical iPhone
drives cover preselection, toggles, disabled trash, confirmation/cancellation,
draft retention, empty deletion, and entry from groups and focused replies.
Selection circles center on the bubble row independently of sender labels,
reactions, and reply counts; both hosts verify the centers and circle taps.
A normal-mode iPhone capture also verifies physical More, a second selection,
and confirmed deletion of exactly those two bubbles.
Forward opens the shared New Message sheet in the current conversation, with
To focused and the selected bodies joined by newlines in transcript order.
The text stays editable before choosing a recipient; Send requires a valid
recipient and nonblank body. Cancel returns to the source conversation with
selection exited, the keyboard closed, and its draft/reply target intact.
Sending creates one local message with the edited text, without copying reaction
or reply metadata, and preserves the source draft when forwarding elsewhere.
Browser and physical iPhone drives cover single/multiple selection, keyboard
entry into To, editing before a recipient, cancellation, sending to another
fixture contact, group history isolation, focused replies, and a clean later
compose session. Baked-module tests cover ordering, duplicate IDs, and exclusion
of unrelated IDs. These behaviors follow captured native single/multiple forwards;
the recipient keyboard now matches the reference height, as documented above.
An ordinary iPhone run also forwards two messages through physical More/Forward
taps, software-keyboard recipient entry, recipient selection, and Send, retaining
the keyboard in the destination conversation. Shared-sheet regression drives
verify zero-selection Forward, recipient removal/re-addition with the draft
retained, and a new local group; the iPhone uses its software Backspace key.
The forwarding sheet now disables the underlying conversation Back control.
UIKit’s back recognizers honor that disabled state before starting, so edge and
header swipes cannot navigate the source route out from under the sheet. Its
header retains focus on release. Browser pointer drags and physical iPhone
swipes preserve the sheet, recipient focus, forwarded text, and source draft;
cancellation restores ordinary Back gestures and contact-details Back. Native
Messages captures show the same stationary sheet and retained keyboard. An
ordinary iPhone run verifies both swipe origins, a subsequent software-keyboard
keystroke, and cancellation returning to its original H draft with the keyboard
closed. Cancelling and completing Back then restores the full-height inbox
with that draft preserved. Removing the focused sheet had synchronously resized
inside an older frame batch, whose remaining frames overwrote the restored
height. The iOS presenter now defers that keyboard update until the batch ends,
retaining its animation duration and curve. An ordinary Simulator capture verifies
the restored inbox; the physical navigation drive also checks the painted search
bar returns to y=798, matching its initial position, with zero keyboard overlap.
The forwarding regression also passes single/multiple sends, editing before
recipient choice, and source draft/reply preservation. Ordinary Simulator drags
retain interactive keyboard tracking, reversal, and completed dismissal.
Compose is now a separate modal route. UIKit supplies its large-sheet
presentation, downward drag, reversal, and dismissal; the browser keeps the
source route visible and inert and handles Escape. An empty new draft permits
dismissal, while populated forwarding springs back with its text and keyboard
retained, matching the two native reference cases. The active viewport uses the
sheet's coordinates and keyboard guide. Its horizontal-Back freeze is excluded
from modal transitions: an earlier attempt incorrectly froze the empty sheet's
layout during dismissal and let the composer slide under the keyboard.
The ordinary iPhone drive now holds the empty sheet at y=252 with its composer
beside the keyboard, reverses it, and completes dismissal to the full-height inbox.
Repeating this physical sequence after the spelling-check fix retains the composer
beside the now 308-point keyboard; a subsequent keyboard touch still edits To. A
populated forward also resists a full downward drag, springs back with its body
intact, and accepts a subsequent software-keyboard touch in To.
An ordinary Simulator reload with the sheet open also returns to the full-height
inbox. Modal teardown defers resizing until the new runtime's first batch is mounted.
Host-owned dimming removes the duplicate corner seam: the 160×124-pixel upper-left
light-mode crop now matches the native capture exactly. The corresponding dark
crop still differs slightly at its edge (mean RGB error 0.17/255); its sheet
surface is the same #1c1c1e. The native host now resolves inherited text color
from the logical tree: inbox headings, names and compose titles follow the
root's light/dark pair without local color overrides. Kernel/host regressions
cover ancestor changes, reparenting and cleared overrides. The sheet now keeps its
source controller and views live in the presenting surface, so changing appearance
while it is open also updates the source background, text and native materials.
The source retains its pre-sheet geometry; deferred frame/content updates are
replayed before normal layout returns. Source interaction and accessibility are
suppressed until closing. Ordinary held-sheet captures verify light → dark → light
behind the sheet, with the keyboard/composer still in place. A populated sheet
still springs back and accepts recipient typing after the appearance changes.
Back and forwarding regressions pass; reloading the ordinary app with a live
source behind an empty sheet restores the full-height inbox without runtime errors.
An initially selected modal fixture passes editing, dismissal refusal and Close; its corrected trace draws the source before presenting the sheet (LLP 1035.001 D8; `/tmp/messages-title-structure/startup-events-r2.json`).
The normal application starts at the inbox; full startup motion parity remains unverified.
Complete presentation/close timing still needs comparison; these captures do
not prove every intermediate frame matches.
Selection now retains the hidden receipt’s layout space and reserves ten points above the toolbar. The same nine outgoing bodies move up 17⅔ points on iPhone versus native 17, replacing the previous downward jump; Cancel restores the baseline. Four physical iPhone and four browser individual/group light/dark cases preserve drafts, bubble widths, outgoing positions and selection controls (`/tmp/messages-selection-indent/verification.json`).
The third/final candidate leaves about ⅔ point of displacement error; off-bottom anchoring, selection/deletion motion and exact symbol rasterization remain unfinished.

The standard laugh reaction is now a separate `haha` value from the 😂 emoji,
matching the distinct choices in [Apple’s Tapback reference](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/react-with-tapbacks-iph018d3c336/26/ios/26).
It renders as a blue, two-line HA HA shape in the picker and reaction badge;
its glossy native artwork is still an approximation. Focused inline threads
now display reaction badges too. Their badges reopen the picker for changing or
removing a reaction, and both views read the same saved message value. Reaction
badges opt into `retainFocus`, so opening their picker preserves the current
editing session even before the context panel exists. Browser and iOS drives
verify distinct selection, replacement, removal, and shared badges; real Simulator
taps reopen badges in both thread views without losing the draft or keyboard.
Opening a badge while the keyboard is closed leaves it closed.
A bubble-bound badge wrapper was tried to improve incoming badge placement.
It preserved widths after switching from flex to block layout, but physical
iPhone badge taps regressed intermittently. Moving the reply gesture to the
wrapper also broke browser badge taps. The layout experiment was reverted at
the three-round limit. After reverting, browser and physical iPhone checks
again passed badge reopening, replacement/removal, and draft/keyboard retention.
The later sibling-slot candidate was initially reverted too, then restored
after the foreground-verified physical proof above. It supplies the inner-edge
anchor; movement with reply drags remains unfinished.

Both composers use CSS `field-sizing: content`, 20-point lines and the available height, replacing the six-line cap. The measured 38×28 Send control and 5-point text/control gap leave 252.67 points for text on the pinned iPhone; the empty microphone stays in the trailing 28-point slot.
Native reference and browser/iOS drives cover 1–32 lines, shrinkage and a trailing Return; 11 physical cases, ordinary-launch typing and final baked Send/navigation checks pass (`/tmp/messages-composer-growth/`). Six wrapping specimens now match native line counts/heights; 44 browser/iOS cases, eight physical wrapping/deletion/emoji cases and both baked Send/navigation drives pass (`/tmp/messages-wrapping/`). Glyph rasterization still differs.
The conversation surface matches the measured 40.33-point first line and 365.67-point height limit; Compose caps two points above the native reference and remains open.
A terminal Return reserves its caret line without changing the draft. Physical typing and Paste keep it visible. The driver now observes both caret scrolling and native viewport geometry through an idle turn after keyboard or sheet handoff; immediate/later captures and held manual scrolling pass (`/tmp/messages-editor-paste/`, `/tmp/messages-viewport-settle/`).
Sending shrinks the cleared composer and requests the transcript bottom. Changed DOM `scrollTop` bindings apply once after the batch's children/layout are mounted.
The transcript's explicit `scrollFollowEnd` policy keeps the bottom visible through keyboard and composer resizing while reading the latest message.
After scrolling up, the browser uses CSS scroll anchoring, and iOS retains a visible descendant’s position across the batch.
A shared fixture verifies that growing and shrinking content above the reader
leaves the visible message in place; it previously jumped by the changed height.
Physical Simulator taps also verify that adjustment and that the top stays at zero.
If the native anchor disappears, iOS now uses the next surviving visible
candidate. It keeps that choice through later updates until the reader scrolls;
only when no candidate survives does it clamp the old offset. The deletion
fixture exposed a 70-point iPhone jump that the browser avoided. Browser and
iPhone drives now cover multiple deletions, hidden rows, restoration, growth,
manual scrolling, and empty/top/bottom boundaries. The earlier direct-delete chat flow also preserved the next bubble, draft and
keyboard when deleting a partly clipped message. The current More/selection
flow hides the keyboard; its reading-anchor behavior remains to be compared.
An explicit send still requests the bottom. These paths have passed on iOS and web.

Sending also schedules a deterministic offline response. After three 300 ms
fixture ticks, the sender’s three-dot typing bubble appears; after fifteen ticks,
it becomes one incoming message. Another send replaces that conversation’s pending
response. Other conversations retain their own pending response, and an inline
response stays attached to its reply root. The fixture marks a received message
unread when its conversation is not open. No timer state changes while replies are
idle. Dots use authored scale/opacity transitions; UIKit and CSS execute them.
The group fixture includes the typing sender’s avatar, following [iOS 26’s group
typing behavior](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/).
Browser/iOS drives verify appearance, changing dot scale, incoming replacement,
draft retention, end following, stable scrolled reading position, conversation
isolation, and group/inline indicators. Real Simulator taps on the keyboard H key
and Send also show the typing bubble becoming a reply with the keyboard still open.
The indicator’s dimensions, pulse curve, and insertion/removal motion still need
direct comparison with the target Messages version; this is not a timing parity claim.

Leaving a conversation retains its draft and reply target in memory; sending
clears the saved draft. Sending inside a focused reply thread leaves that thread
open for another reply. Switching between conversations verifies draft isolation.

The conversation starts with the reference's two-line service banner: `iMessage`
and a small lock beside `Encrypted`. The date follows below it with a tighter
gap before the first bubble. On the fresh iOS 26.5 Simulator build, the banner
starts at y=172, the date at y=212.67, and the first short bubble at y=232.67;
the saved native reference's bubble starts at y=232.33 (one device pixel apart).
Browser touch input and Simulator pointer input preserve the banner and date
through held timestamp reveal and release; saved native crops are identical at
every held position. The new cold-baked app also preserves the banner in dark
appearance and retains an unsent draft through Back/reopen. The lock is an
authored path pending native symbol access; this verifies the added content and
spacing, not exact SF Symbol artwork or text-baseline parity.
An empty conversation shows neither service line, matching the empty native
Simulator conversation. Deleting the final message removes the banner; an
unsent draft survives Back/reopen without bringing it back, and sending restores
it. Browser and iOS drives verify that lifecycle.

Dragging the transcript left reveals each message's timestamp; releasing returns
it to its resting position. This has passed browser touch input and actual
Simulator dragging, including a vertical drag that still scrolls the conversation.
The browser executes CSS scroll snap, and UIKit adjusts the native scroll view's
deceleration destination. The timestamp container uses `scrollbar-width: none`
to hide the extra track while preserving scrolling and snap. Timestamps now center
vertically on the bubble itself, independently of sender labels, reactions,
quoted text, delivery status, and reply counts. Browser layout measurements retain
the original bubble wrapping and positions; browser and iOS drives check timestamp
centers for one-to-one and group messages. Browser touch and physical iPhone input
also retain reaction-badge taps and swipe-to-reply after this layout change.

The iOS 26.5 Simulator's local Kate Bell/John Appleseed simulation supplies a native
reference: short and three-line bubbles center their timestamps vertically.
Smooth native drags of 40/80/120/180/240 points moved the bubbles approximately
14/31/46/58/58 points. The example now uses 40% of the scroll distance, capped at
58 points, and compensates date/service labels so they stay centered. Browser
and physical iPhone captures verify the cap, the stationary labels, and return;
the iPhone's corresponding partial offsets were 11/28/44 points, so recognition
thresholds still differ slightly. A fixed scroll extent keeps the compensation
from growing the scroll range. Timestamps are right-aligned in the revealed strip
and hidden at rest. Opening/leaving a conversation resets the gesture state.

Frame-by-frame video exposed delayed native scroll callbacks causing up to
14-point return jitter. User scrolling now dispatches before painting, while
layout-generated changes still coalesce after their batch. Mandatory snapping
uses UIKit's fast deceleration rate. The remaining sub-point variation in the
recording is within the video/pixel measurement precision. The recorded return
from a held 240-point drag settled within half a point in about 0.68 seconds,
versus 0.58 seconds in Messages; the example returns faster in its early frames.
This improves the previous roughly two-second return but is not an exact curve
match.

A fresh isolated iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 Simulator recording after the fractional
kernel-frame and explicit line-height repairs still shows the mismatch. Saved
pixels give 12/28/44/58/58-point travel for 40/80/120/180/240-point drags;
the service/date-label crops are unchanged at every held position and after
release. Using the last frame within one point of the held position as the
time origin for both recordings, Exact returns 33.67 points by 0.10 seconds
and 48.67 by 0.20; the saved native reference returns 18.67 and 38 points.
Exact reaches within half a point of rest at about 0.73 seconds, versus
0.60 in that reference. This is an agent launch with real Simulator pointer
events and UIKit scroll timing, not an ordinary-launch timing verification.
The first attempted capture opened Tapback and was rejected; an isolated
helper with explicit mouse movement deltas produced the verified drag.
Its checks require visible bubble travel, stationary labels, no Tapback
selection and complete return, rather than treating input dispatch as proof.
The temporary recording and per-frame measurements are under
`/tmp/messages-timestamp-current/` (`verified-evidence.json`). Fractional
layout alone does not fix the release curve; that remains open.
A separate UIKit-only probe reproduced the long tail using the same five-step
drag, resisted/capped geometry, fast deceleration and a delegate-selected zero
destination: about 0.72 seconds to within half a point. Enabling native paging
returned in about 0.27 seconds with either deceleration rate and introduced a
small scroll-offset overshoot. All three returned to zero, but paging did not
match Messages. The probe is under `/tmp/messages-snap-study/`; no paging change
was applied to Exact's scroll host.

A further UIKit-only comparison isolates scroll extent from deceleration rate.
Limiting the extent to 145 points (58 points of visible travel at 40%) removes
the hidden excess distance but still returns about 36 points in the first
100 ms, versus about 19 in Messages. UIKit's normal deceleration rate takes
about 2.6 seconds to return, with either extent. Native overscroll returns
about 35 points in the first 100 ms; that sample had a small nonzero release
velocity and is not a zero-velocity comparison. These variants do not fix
the curve, so neither the app's extent nor the host's deceleration was changed.

A direct pan with a UIKit spring (`mass: 1`, `stiffness: 121`, `damping: 22`,
zero initial velocity) is closer. Saved video pixels give 21.67 points returned
at 100 ms, 40.23 at 200 ms, and within half a point of rest at 0.58 seconds;
the reference gives 18.67, 38, and 0.60 respectively. The spring's RMS position
error against the reference is 1.93 points over the sampled interval. Both
recordings use the last frame within one point of the held position as their
time origin; frame phase limits the comparison. These are fitted probe
parameters, not recovered Messages parameters or an exact match. Artifacts are
under `/tmp/messages-timestamp-rates/`: `spring-video-comparison.json` and
`pixel-comparison.png` contain the pixel comparison; `comparison.json` contains
the separate scroll-delegate and presentation-layer measurements.

A linked Exact spring prototype verifies direct hold/release through the existing motion engine, with the current archive and a paired baked generation.
Actual iPhone drags retain the 58-point cap, stationary labels and draft. Pixel measurements give 19.7/39.3 points returned at 100/200 ms
versus 17.9/37.5 in the interpolated native reference, settling within half a point in 0.615 s versus 0.602 s. RMS error over 20–700 ms is
1.14 points, versus 7.70 for scroll snap. Frame phase and fitted parameters limit the claim. A separate drive preserves vertical scrolling and reversal.
`/tmp/messages-timestamp-linked/` holds the input/video; its wrong-host recording and rejected unbaked-plan attempt are excluded.
The app still uses scroll snap: the spring probe’s test-ID target lookup needs authored intent and a browser implementation. Charlie approved three further
attempts on 2026-09-11. R4 reuses native editor exclusion and identity-bound Presenter.dragX delivery: physical selection drags move rows by 0 points
(previously 44); Back during a held drag produces 0 gone-target writes (previously 11), retaining the draft. R5 fails compilation because inset() clip-path
is unsupported; R6 margins/overflow hide rest labels, preserve 23 native node rectangles and pass 10 physical assertions. Browser geometry passes; gesture binding remains open (`/tmp/messages-timestamp-ownership/r6/`).
The analogous production reply teardown error is repaired: motion and Reply dispatch use the presenter's post-batch queue and verify view identity.
Public touches verify short release, completed Reply and Back while held, with no retired write and exactly one Reply dispatch (`/tmp/messages-gesture-retirement/`).

The normal iPhone app also retains timestamp reversal and interactive
keyboard dismissal/reversal with the composer tracking the keyboard. Regression
drives cover inbox read/unread reveal, mute/delete, mirrored scroll offsets,
hidden-scroll restoration, and leaving a conversation during timestamp reveal.
The first inbox run missed the initial gesture and another lost the row; a direct
physical probe and the isolated full run passed without another product change.
The cause of those initial drive failures is not established.
Browser touch and physical Simulator drags verify the hidden track alongside timestamp reveal, return, vertical scrolling,
and swipe-to-reply. A separate fixture switches `auto` → `none` → `thin` → `auto`
without changing the viewport or losing scrolling; native captures show the
indicator disappearing and returning.
The app's surface and text colors follow the system appearance.

The software keyboard has now been verified through timed Simulator touches:
the viewport shrinks by its 335-point overlap, the composer rides above it,
and the bottom safe-area inset becomes zero. UIKit's interactive dismissal
tracks a downward drag; its keyboard layout guide keeps the composer adjacent
through the intermediate frames. This has been driven in the ordinary app,
outside agent mode, where the real keyboard animation runs.
Reversing the drag keeps the keyboard open, and tapping its H key edits the
draft through the native text-input path.

The visual reference is the installed iOS 26.5, pending a different user choice.
Direct inspection of its inbox and conversation informed the bottom search pill,
60-point contact avatar, floating back/name controls, and curved bubble tails.
These render on iOS and web. Bubble tails now use curved CSS clipping paths,
so their outside edges stay transparent over blurred replies and dimmed Tapbacks
in light and dark appearance. The same paths mask native views. Browser and
iPhone simulator captures verify both reply and reaction previews; a separate
clipped-child fixture verifies that real taps outside a curve reach the view
underneath.

Bubble geometry now follows additional iOS 26.5 sample measurements: a 48-point
minimum width, 40-point single-line height, 20-point line spacing, 14-point
horizontal padding, 20-point corners, 16-point transcript side insets, and
4-point spacing within a sender run. The minimum-sized bubbles center their text.
Tails extend below the bubble while staying inside its horizontal edge; the
incoming contour mirrors the sampled outgoing shape. Main messages, focused
replies, and Tapback previews share the dimensions. Group previews retain the
source's 44-point avatar indentation.
Browser and iPhone measurements verify short, multiline, and group cases, along
with reaction selection and opening focused replies. An unsupported percentage
calculation in the first group-preview attempt was replaced by nested layout;
the final group preview opens on both surfaces.

Main, focused, and preview bubbles now use the same two named tail paths.
They follow a measured Messages silhouette, including its rounded tip and the
curve turning inward above it. Three outgoing iPhone samples reduced sampled
edge error from about 0.78 points to 0.10 points; four incoming samples, including
multiline bubbles, are about 0.11 points from the independently captured native
incoming contour. These comparisons normalize to the painted bubble bottom:
they do not hide the remaining fractional body-height/rasterization difference
or establish pixel equality. Bubble frames are unchanged. Browser and iPhone
drives verify focused replies, preview restoration, reactions, and appearance
changes; real Simulator presses and a held palette drag retain draft/keyboard
behavior. An ordinary launch also reveals timestamps by 58 points, returns to
an identical blue-bubble pixel mask, and selects a reaction by double tap and
touch. `/tmp/messages-tail-contour/` holds the contours, scores, captures, and
verification results.

The short native samples measured approximately 48×40 for H/Hi, 67×40 for Hello,
and 113×40 for Hello world. Exact's iPhone results are 48×40, 67×40, and 114×40.
The long reference wraps into the same three lines at 80 points high, but its
background is roughly 262 points wide versus Exact's 277; native Messages shrinks
that balloon to its wrapped text. Exact currently limits a border-box bubble to
75% of the available row. A browser probe also keeps 277.5 points with flex,
column, block, inline-block, fit-content and grid layout. Tightening to wrapped ink
needs a separate sizing design. UIKit `sizeThatFits` now reproduces 261⅔ points for the recorded sentence; Chrome 152 reports no support for the proposed [`max-content-sizing`](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-shrink-to-fit/blob/main/README.md) property, including with the named `CssMaxContentSizing` prototype flag; 64 browser cases retain the current widths (`/tmp/messages-intrinsic-width/`, `/tmp/messages-wrapped-sizing/`). Changing the native kernel’s CSS sizing alone would
create a host disagreement. The comparison also exposed a separate defect: 45 unbroken W characters overflowed one web line. Messages now declares CSS `overflow-wrap: break-word`; both hosts show three lines at 80 points, with iOS preview, reaction and focused-reply activation checked (`/tmp/messages-overflow-wrap/`). A subsequent Taffy intrinsic-sizing repair restores H/Hi from 56 to 48 points without changing authored padding; 48 kernel cases, the browser fixture and rebuilt iPhone samples pass (`/tmp/messages-short-width/`). Scaled Tapback images now contribute their displayed box to scrollable overflow: the short focused reply has a 114.33-point extent and zero offset, with its full time label, badge and bubble visible in the rebuilt physical drive (`/tmp/messages-reply-overflow/`). That intrinsic-sizing difference, fractional bubble
rasterization, and sender-name repetition after pauses remain fidelity work. The initial
multiline native preview was narrower than its source; the final shared row
layout gives main/reply/preview matching measured widths and indentation.

The composer, add control, header controls, and inbox search use UIKit’s regular
glass on iOS 26, with a CSS
approximation on web and ultra-thin blur on earlier iOS. On the reference iPhone,
the resting side and bottom insets are 28 points; opening the keyboard changes
them to 16. Both controls start at 40 points high. Existing CSS safe-area lengths
and zero-minimum spacers produce that adjustment. Multiline growth and clearing
a sent draft preserve the gap above the keyboard. Browser/iOS drives check those
measurements, send/reset, and reactions retaining the draft and keyboard. Actual
Simulator taps also verify focusing the composer, keyboard H, and Send in the
ordinary app. A physical downward drag dismisses the keyboard and restores the
28-point resting insets. Appearance changes also repaint the placeholder and the window
background visible around the keyboard’s rounded corners. The microphone is now a
native symbol, also used in the inbox search; dictation is still inactive. The
resting search bar shares the reference’s 28-point bottom inset. Glass-backed
buttons hold their content in UIKit’s effect and enable its interactive response.
A held Simulator Back press visibly enlarges the glass and release navigates back.
Browser/iOS drives also check search filtering, contact details, and closing inline
replies through the new material. A native fixture changes glass to blur, clears it,
and restores glass while retaining child actions and physical taps on visible
overflow. Exact native glyph sizing and glass grouping remain unfinished.

Back, Close, Compose, Add, Microphone, Send, Search, Copy, Select, More, Delete and Forward now use `symbol:` images.
UIKit renders each glyph inside the kernel-owned box; the web uses generic masks, and Fieldnotes shares Add/Close.
Physical iOS controls and browser actions pass in light/dark; the native renderer prototype matches 210 UIKit cases. Compose Close now uses 22/400, matching the native 50×50-pixel ink bounds; tint and one-pixel alignment still differ. Other glyph sizes, VoiceOver and macOS pixels remain open (LLP 1035.004 D4; `/tmp/messages-symbol-integration/verification.json`). Copy, Select and More now use 17/400 native image leaves with the reference’s measured intrinsic sizes. Their three schema roles replace seven further nodes; six physical glyph taps and six browser actions pass in light/dark, preserving drafts and existing menu frames. Shape overlap improves in all six reference crops, but remaining raster differences, Reply/Translate and material parity stay open (`/tmp/messages-action-symbols/verification.json`).

Delete and Forward now use 22-point regular native images. Four iOS Simulator touch cases and four browser cases cover disabled controls, outside cancellation, local deletion and populated forwarding with draft retention. The final image offsets preserve all surrounding measured frames; fixed-crop shape overlap improves from 31–39% to 89–93%. Foreground/material and edge raster differences remain (`/tmp/messages-selection-symbols/verification.json`).

Contact details now pushes a third keyed route with its own Back control, an
80-point avatar, 48-point action circles, an address card and Hide Alerts. The
unknown-phone layout was compared directly with MobileSMS on iOS 26.5; its card
background is `#efeff0`. Fixture phone numbers resolve to their existing contacts.
Hide Alerts changes the same in-memory mute state as the inbox swipe action.
The conversation stays mounted beneath details. Browser and physical Simulator
drives verify mute synchronization, draft retention and prior composer focus:
opening details hides the keyboard, Back restores it only if it was previously
focused, and opening another conversation does not inherit that focus. Details
uses `touch-action: pan-y` so its scroller yields horizontal back gestures.
Native swipe cancellation and completion pass both with the agent connection and
in the ordinary app with live UIKit transitions; held, cancelled and completed
swipes were captured with a real keyboard H draft. Both browser and iOS now
retain the reading position when Back restores the keyboard. Native inspection
isolated the former 160-point jump: the retained transcript grew from 313 to
636 points while details was open, clamping its offset from 260.67 to 97.67;
end-following then treated that clamp as the reader choosing the bottom.
The host now preserves the unpinned position while the route is inactive,
including while it is still attached during an animated push. It also records
UIKit's actual stored offset: its fractional quantization had been mistaken
for a user scroll, invalidating the retained position.

The bounded third-round repair covers browser/iOS reading, later manual scroll,
top/end following, and returning without prior composer focus. Physical and ordinary-launch
Back controls and cancelled/completed swipes preserve the draft and reading anchor.
Settled transcript crops differ in only 14 one-channel pixels for button Back and six for
swipe completion; the completed-swipe keyboard crop is identical (`/tmp/messages-details-inspection/`).
Calling, video, email and existing-contact editing remain disabled. Local Block/Unblock works, with cancellation, draft restoration and pending fixture-reply suppression.
`/tmp/messages-contact-actions/` records native Block/New Contact and their public-UIKit confirmation prototypes. Block's crop matches over a saved backdrop; Discard's material still differs.
The integrated confirmation passes physical actions and two-session editor retention, exactly-once dispatch, reload refusal, unmount and destruction (`/tmp/messages-confirmation-integration/`). Explicit `destructive=true` gives Block/Discard native red (`/tmp/messages-destructive-actions/verification.json`). Correcting contact-row CSS sizes now matches Block's sheet/action rectangles and restores full-row hit areas; browser checks and 22 physical captures pass cancellation, local Save and swipe Delete (`/tmp/messages-contact-geometry/verification.json`, LLP 1021 D2). Red text bounds match native; material and browser placement remain open.
New Contact now edits names, company, one phone/email and notes and saves only to the local fixture. Close confirms even before editing the prefilled address; cancellation retains the actual editor and typing continues. Browser Escape now closes that confirmation while retaining the form and focused editor; a second Escape respects the sheet’s dismissal refusal (`/tmp/messages-popover-escape/`). Discard returns to details; reopening starts fresh.
iOS/browser activation checks cover local save, renamed inbox lookup and conversation draft/focus restoration. Real XCTest software keys and touches also cover outside cancellation, a downward sheet drag, scrolling, discard and local save (`/tmp/messages-new-contact/`).
The contact model preserves existing thread identity/history/drafts, adds no empty inbox row and excludes address-less contacts from recipients; its baked-module test covers these cases.
The form remains incomplete: additional addresses, photo/pronoun/tone controls, other native fields, contact editing and exact artwork are owed. Native Add to Existing Contact now has a captured reference: a searchable, surname-grouped chooser opens an untitled editor with the existing values plus the incoming address; Close → Discard returns directly to details. The three implementation candidates stopped at compilation (unsupported symbol, mixed number/string branches, numeric text); their unverified code is preserved under `/tmp/messages-existing-contact/r3/` and the prior app is restored. No chooser implementation lands from this attempt.
Its sheet begins at y=62 versus native y=72. A public-UIKit container probe gets y=62 for the first sheet across styles and y=72 above an existing modal; Exact currently pushes details. Presentation ownership needs integration, not an app padding offset.
The discard action rectangle matches native; full material, keyboard-transition and form parity remain open. The rebuilt-app repeat passes functionally but incurs 13 XCTest idle timeouts. Confirmation dispatch now waits until UIKit’s callback stack returns; two fresh physical runs and pending-action reload/destruction checks pass (`/tmp/messages-confirmation-completion/`). The original intermittent timeout’s cause remains unproven. No native Messages send or Contacts save was performed.
Group/shared-content sections, switch motion, exact symbols and the full contact card remain unfinished.

The inbox remains mounted behind the conversation; UIKit owns controller containment and navigation.
Only a completed interactive pop from the still-live, selected source invokes Back. Its control must belong to that route; inactive/disabled controls cannot authorize a pop or sheet dismissal (`/tmp/messages-back-owner/`). A late programmatic
completion cannot cancel a newer route. Deferred route intent and focus apply after the native handoff.
`/tmp/messages-navigation-completion/` passes rapid Back → Compose with focus, keyboard, saved drafts and header Back cancel/complete.
The XCTest drive in `/tmp/messages-keyboard-guide/` keeps the multiline composer, native first responder,
335-point inset and 539-point viewport stable through cancellation. The guide also replaces a four-point-wrong landscape notification edge: `/tmp/messages-rotation/` matches native composer y=141.667 and viewport 874×198 in both landscape directions, then 482.667/402×539 in portrait, retaining the editor and draft.
Completion saves the draft and hides the keyboard; sheet resistance, two-session focus/destruction and stable initial keyboard geometry pass. Landscape header and keyboard-control parity remain open. Web Back retains inactive routes as hidden/inert DOM nodes.
Unmounted focus waits against the target editor's identity; First Send installs the selected conversation before sheet dismissal, removing the inbox flash (`/tmp/messages-compose-handoff/`).
Both Send controls now declare `retainFocus`; browser focus/blur events disappear, and production ordinary Send retains its editor, visible keyboard and viewport (`/tmp/messages-keyboard-handoff/`).
First Send's keyboard drop is repaired by retaining the outgoing native editor hierarchy and handing focus to the destination before dismissing its sheet. An uninstrumented physical drive has no hidden-keyboard samples, and sampled video keeps the Q key at its original height. Seven Back/sheet cases and two-session reload/unmount/destruction pass (`/tmp/messages-editor-retirement/`). Native Compose opens via `sms:`, but fixture recipients remain `No Name, Searching`; no native Send was issued, so native first-Send animation parity is still unestablished (`/tmp/messages-native-send-reference/verification.json`).
The shared host now admits authored `inert` and preserves subtree geometry/drafts while excluding iOS/browser input; modal-owner and Messages regressions pass, including rebuilt browser modal focus/inspection, single dispatch and input restoration (`/tmp/messages-inert-ownership/`). This ownership repair changes no Messages markup. Native dismissal retains its owner until UIKit completes, including across reload, then projects current route intent (`/tmp/messages-modal-retirement/`). Completed sheet gestures now release the old modal-navigation slot after UIKit’s callback returns and dispatch only for the same live, selected source. Retained/replacement routes and mid-gesture permission changes pass six physical cases (`/tmp/messages-dismissal-owner/`). Revocation after native commitment re-presents the selected route with its keyboard closed; continuous editing through that outcome is not established. Unmount now retires native owners without invoking Back: physical drag unmount/destruction and offscreen route replacement pass, with retained Compose state and queued focus delivered after remount (`/tmp/messages-unmounted-owner/`). Moving to another UIKit controller in the same window now passes, including transfer during a physical sheet drag; the old completion leaves Compose intact and an offscreen replacement’s queued focus reaches its new editor (`/tmp/messages-reparent-owner/`). Unmount ends existing focus; this verifies explicit queued focus, not continuous keyboard editing through a move. A fresh native recording also shows contact details zooming from the photo, rather than the current horizontal push. A public UIKit fullscreen zoom and nested sheet reproduces New Contact’s y=416 first field; cancellation, refusal, completion and missing-source Back pass in the prototype. Charlie approved the fullscreen/source Messages exception and three additional attempts in LLP 1035.001. R4 fixes Compose by distinguishing route transitions from enclosing presentation callbacks; R5 handles browser Escape after the covered editor loses focus. Fullscreen details and nested New Contact now pass the iOS/browser flow, ten physical gesture cases, source removal/replacement, and nested host unmount/reload/transfer/destruction (`/tmp/messages-fullscreen/r4/`, `r5/`). The third additional attempt is unused. Native pixel/motion parity remains open; the physical ownership fixture had its software keyboard hidden at baseline, while the Messages activation drive verifies a visible-keyboard return. The earlier prototype remains in `/tmp/messages-presentation-ancestry/`.
Timestamp-area swipes still go to that horizontal scroll view; arbitration remains unresolved.
These checks do not establish full navigation or first-layout parity.

A subsequent app-only probe added `touch-action="pan-right pan-y"` to the
timestamp container, using the already-supported initial-direction policy.
With a keyboard draft, the baseline ignored rightward drags from both x=5 at
the screen edge and x=60 in the gutter beside an outgoing bubble. The candidate
allowed the edge drag to return to the inbox; the gutter drag still did not.
It was reverted because the native comparison did not establish the intended
navigation behavior. On a fresh iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 simulated Messages session,
rightward edge and gutter drags over an empty conversation did nothing. After
populating its local simulated conversation, edge drags from x=5 and x=15 and
a header drag also did nothing. The same helper's leftward drag revealed
timestamps by about 58 points, and tapping Back returned to the inbox. A
subsequent edge drag on the simulated incoming conversation, with the keyboard
closed, also did not navigate. These controls establish that input reached the
app; they do not establish why its navigation recognizer declined those drags
or that an ordinary iMessage conversation should decline them. A reference
that demonstrates the navigation gesture is needed before this candidate can
be called a parity fix. Captures, before/candidate state and the native pixel
measurements are under `/tmp/messages-transcript-back/`. The app retains its
original timestamp touch policy.

Inline replies now use stable message IDs. Long-press Reply opens the selected
root and its replies over a blurred conversation; the composer stays in place.
Sending keeps the focused thread open, and its reply-count control reopens it
from the main conversation. Close or the exposed blurred background returns to
the conversation. UIKit supplies the ultra-thin material; the browser uses a CSS
approximation. Exact thread positioning and connecting lines,
and the opening/closing motion are still unfinished. The ordinary iOS app has
been driven with physical long-press → Reply → keyboard H → Send touches: it
adds the reply and leaves the keyboard and thread open. Browser and iOS agent
checks cover repeated replies, closing, and reopening via the reply count.
Deleting the original bubble retains the thread ID: subsequent sends, typing,
and the offline incoming reply stay in the focused thread, including when no
bubbles remain at deletion. Web and iOS drives verify this and reopening from a
surviving reply. The exact Messages deletion transition still needs comparison.
The group fixture separates sender names from message text in both views,
following the [current iOS 26 inline-reply reference](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph82fb73ba3/26/ios/26).
Names start incoming sender sequences; 32-point initial avatars sit beside each
run's final bubble, with an 8-point gap. A run requires the same sender, direction
and day, with less than 60 seconds between adjacent messages. The focused thread
groups only its visible messages. A controlled native Simulator drive joined
30.005- and 59.004-second gaps and split a 61.002-second gap; an earlier pause of
at least 68.9 seconds split too. That brackets the chosen one-minute cutoff;
behavior at exactly 60 seconds has not been independently resolved. Native
captures also show the tighter gap within a run and a tail at its end.
Browser and iOS drives reproduce the 30/59/61 cases, including a joined run
whose displayed time crosses a minute, and measure 4-point gaps within a run
and 10 points between runs. Deleting an intervening message recomputes the gap
from the survivors' timestamps; focused replies use the same rule. The native
captures and recorded input times are under `/tmp/messages-grouping-study/`.
Group-name repetition after a pause, avatar artwork and exact fractional spacing
still need direct native comparison. Existing drives also cover changing senders,
reactions, retained drafts, typing and incoming replies.
Physical Simulator and browser touch drags also verify timestamp reveal, reply
entry with the keyboard, and cancellation on the indented group bubbles.
Time labels now use the fixture's day and first visible message in each day,
in both views; sending in an older conversation introduces a Today label.
Focused labels center across the full viewport, including group conversations.
The fixtures' short exchanges share a label, while individual times remain in
the sideways reveal. New sends and simulated replies derive precise timestamps
from the runner's seekable clock, beginning at the fixture's 9:42 AM; displayed
times follow that clock independently of the three-dot animation's 300 ms ticks.
Inbox rows use the latest message's time for both sends and simulated replies.
Deleting that message restores the preceding message's time; deleting the final
message leaves no timestamp, including while retaining a draft. A new send
restores it. Baked-module and browser/iOS drives cover these changes across a
minute boundary (`/tmp/messages-grouping-study/inbox-time-*`); the iOS captures
also check that the new row's timestamp remains inside the viewport.
The calendar labels remain fixed. The threshold for an additional same-day date
heading and exact date typography still need Messages comparison; it is separate
from the bubble-run cutoff above.
A fresh local Messages Simulator sequence kept its original Today heading after
a 301.003-second pause, then a 299.001-second pause (600.005 seconds from the
first send). All three balloons retained their tails. The current browser and
iPhone builds reproduce that heading count and the separate bubble runs; a
five-minute inactivity cutoff would introduce a mismatch in this reference.
`/tmp/messages-date-headings/` holds the input times, native and Exact captures,
OCR coordinates, and layout reads. This does not establish the threshold for a
longer uninterrupted pause, group-name repetition, or calendar rollover.
A subsequent measured 601.005-second native pause also retained the original
heading (`long-input-time.json`, `native-gap-601.png` in that directory); a
ten-minute inactivity cutoff would disagree with this reference too.
A further 901.005-second native pause still kept that heading
(`fifteen-input-time.json`, `native-gap-901.png`). The bounded five-, ten-,
and fifteen-minute exploration has not established a same-day cutoff; do
not introduce one from these samples.
Verification also exposed a host batching defect: a seek crossing typing and
incoming timers could attach the incoming view before creating it. Apple and
web now create surviving views before applying the final child lists; both
hosts have a regression for the multi-timer sequence.
The fixture assumes recipients share [read receipts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph5e713a045/ios).
Delivered/Read sits below the latest outgoing bubble in each view and remains
there when an incoming reply arrives. New sends show Delivered; the offline
recipient's typing start changes it to Read. Deleting the latest sent message
reveals the preceding outgoing message's saved status. These are local fixture
events, with exact receipt typography and transition motion still unverified.
Web and iOS drives verify the label's position, Delivered-to-Read change,
retention after an incoming reply, deletion, and independent focused-thread status.
The context preview also retains that view's outgoing receipt, as the native
Messages samples do. It updates from Delivered to Read while the menu stays
open, remains after an incoming reply, and disappears from an older outgoing
preview when a newer message owns the receipt. The focused thread uses its own
latest outgoing message. Browser/iOS drives verify those cases and unchanged
preview line count (`/tmp/messages-reply-motion/preview-receipts-*`). Later
matched native captures corrected the spacing: the painted Delivered label
starts 8 points below the bubble body, with its ink ending about 21 points
inside the bubble's trailing edge. The shared transcript/reply/preview style
now uses a 6⅓-point top margin and 20-point trailing margin; Exact's measured
ink gap is 8 points and trailing inset 21⅓, within one device pixel of the
reference (`/tmp/messages-delivery-spacing/`). This verifies settled placement,
not receipt appearance/transition animation or full typography equality.
UIKit keyboard notifications arrive asynchronously; immediate layout queries
can still observe the intermediate zero-height keyboard.

Right-swiping a bubble now opens its focused reply thread. The bubble follows
the drag with resistance past the threshold; reversing cancels, and release
returns it through the existing transition engine. Physical Simulator drags
verify cancellation, leftward timestamp reveal, vertical scrolling, and a
completed right swipe opening Reply and the keyboard. Chrome touch input passes
the same cases and still supports double-tap reactions. The current 64-point
threshold and 180ms return are provisional. An authored reply arrow now
appears to the bubble’s left as the drag grows, and shrinks/fades on reversal or
release. Its `swipeIndicator` policy holds opacity and scale through the existing
gesture path on web and iOS; it takes no taps or accessibility focus. Exact
indicator geometry, motion, and device haptic comparison remain unfinished.
Browser touch input and physical Simulator drags verify its reveal and return in
both the main and focused thread, with leftward timestamps and vertical scrolling
still available. The native driver captures held scroll gestures before querying
the agent: UIKit defers those queries until its tracking loop releases.
CSS `touch-action: pan-right pan-y` reserves the rightward finger drag without
taking the other directions from scrolling.

A fresh iOS 26.5 Simulator reference cannot calibrate swipe-to-reply: its
simulated conversation sends green messages, ignores the measured rightward
path and offers no Reply in its context menu. The same pointer input reveals
timestamps to the left and opens the native long-press menu. This is a limit
of that reference, not a reason to remove Reply from this iMessage example or
to treat its current constants as verified. The held path, reversal and
captures are in `/tmp/messages-reply-motion/native-held*`.

The 2026-09-10 badge-motion probe confirms the same reference limitation:
holding and moving the green SMS balloon produced a floating drag-and-drop
copy while its original and badge stayed still (`/tmp/messages-reply-badges/`).
That is not a swipe-to-reply sample. No badge-following policy was changed on
the strength of it; a native iMessage reply gesture is still needed.

That reference does support context-preview comparisons. Saved pixels for
short, medium, wide, two-line and three-line outgoing messages show enlargement
of about 15% for the short samples, bounded at roughly 26 points of extra width
for the wider samples, with proportional height growth. Their right edges stay
within about a point of the source edge. These are pixel measurements, not a
recovered UIKit formula: the source view's full bounds and highlight target
remain unknown. `corrected-components.json` in the same directory uses colour
differences to include the green gradient; earlier measurements with an absolute
green threshold truncated the lower portions of several balloons and must not
be used as heights. The shared preview now uses that bounded growth and preserves
its source text geometry; final UIKit pixel rounding/clipping still differs.
Earlier clamped captures showed a readable duplicate source behind the menu;
the source-painting repair below removes it without changing the source geometry.

A public UIKit fixture narrows the preview problem (`/tmp/messages-context-study/`,
iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5). A `UIContextMenuInteraction` with a `UITargetedPreview`
of a rounded view produces these settled preview frames, in points:

| Source size | Preview frame size |
|---|---|
| 67 × 40 | 77⅓ × 46 |
| 113 × 40 | 130 × 46 |
| 188 × 40 | 214 × 45⅔ |
| 262 × 80 | 288 × 88 |
| 280 × 40 | 306 × 44 |

These are converted public `UIView` frames in the fixture's own window, with
saved screenshots, rather than colour-threshold estimates of a Messages bubble.
They reproduce the measured Messages width growth and retain the source's
386-point right edge. The live preview's content can extend fractionally beyond
its surrounding frame; the 280-point sample paints through a 308-point content
frame. The source view's own frame, alpha and hidden flag stay unchanged. Setting
`UIPreviewParameters.backgroundColor` to the bubble colour is necessary in this
fixture: `.clear` preserved the text but removed its filled background.

That default presentation is not a usable replacement for the reaction panel
yet. A custom preview controller renders a reaction button, but a physical tap
on it calls `willPerformPreviewActionForMenuWith` and dismisses the menu, without
invoking the button. The identical button receives its action when mounted as
ordinary content; a physical tap on the native Copy menu item also invokes its
action. This isolates preview interaction from a broken button or pointer path.
It agrees with [UIKit's preview commit contract](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontextmenuinteractiondelegate/contextmenuinteraction(_:willperformpreviewactionformenuwith:animator:)).
No private API was called, and no production context-menu replacement landed.
Any replacement must preserve the interactive, horizontally scrollable reaction
strip and the distinct double-tap/keyboard path as well as native enlargement;
the public preview controller alone does not supply that combination. These
fixture results do not establish Messages' animation curve or which surrounding
badges and labels belong to its preview target.

The existing Contract preview now magnifies on iOS and web by 15%, capped at
26 added points on the larger dimension. It keeps the source's outside edge and vertical
center until the panel needs to clamp to the safe viewport. Following content
moves down within the panel by half the added height, counteracting the panel's
upward shift: the receipt stays at its source-relative position while the
balloon enlarges. The action card reserves the same status-row space even for
incoming or older outgoing messages without a receipt. Clamping includes the
farther extent of the enlarged balloon or following controls; reactions remain ordinary
interactive content. The `contextTarget` belongs to the balloon itself, and a
row around it preserves the source's text layout (the receipt's column had
allowed a three-line native preview to shrink from 277½ to 262 points before
magnification). The row restores matching source/preview layout on both hosts.
The current three-line Exact sample consequently grows from 277½ to 303½ points;
its source is still wider than the native Messages sample, a separate unresolved
text-sizing difference. This does not replace the custom presentation with
`UIContextMenuInteraction` or reproduce its animation and final pixel clipping.

Geometry drives on web and iOS verify scale, source-edge alignment, the unclamped
vertical center, receipt spacing, action clearance, focused replies and live
Delivered-to-Read updates. Physical Simulator long-press and double-tap drives
verify enlarged previews, reaction hits, a held horizontal palette drag and a
later reaction, outside dismissal, group incoming reactions, and keyboard/draft
restoration (`/tmp/messages-preview-enlargement/`). Those captures preceded the
source-painting repair below. An ordinary launch also verifies long-press reaction selection
and double-tap with a retained draft and software keyboard; the saved keyboard
region is pixel-identical before, during and after the double-tap reaction.
macOS retains unscaled positioning through the same nested preview structure,
verified by opening the existing reaction badge and choosing a reaction.

Short and two-line native previews retain the receipt's settled source-relative ink position (`/tmp/messages-delivery-spacing/`). The initial two-line capture caught its appearance animation; two settled captures agree. Web/iOS geometry
drives cover outgoing, older, incoming, focused and clamped previews, live receipts
and source restoration. Physical Simulator input covers long/double taps, reactions,
palette dragging and keyboard/draft retention; ordinary-launch captures verify
pixel-identical balloon/receipt restoration and timestamp return in that directory.

The subsequent long-message comparison (`/tmp/messages-preview-overlap/`) verifies
complete 12- and 24-line native composer values before sending in the Simulator's
built-in fixture. Both native previews retain all lines; their enlarged balloons
also overlap the receipt. Exact therefore removes its eight-line preview cutoff,
keeps the receipt anchor, and caps enlargement by the larger dimension. The tall
native samples support 26-point height growth alongside the earlier width samples.
The native 24-line action card overlaps the balloon but stays above the home indicator; Exact now clamps the trailing control group the same way, ending at
832 points on the designated iPhone. Browser/iOS drives cover short, blank-line,
12/24-line, double-tap and focused-reply previews, reactions and retained drafts.
Public XCTest verifies the 12-line long press, reaction touch and focused draft restoration; native pixel rounding and complete lift/return motion remain unverified.

The duplicate source is now removed through authored `opacity`, on the balloon
and receipt in the active transcript only. The source stays mounted with the
same frame and node identity, so preview placement and scroll geometry remain
valid; dismissal, reaction selection and More restore it. A focused reply's
preview leaves the main transcript's separate representation alone. Live receipt
changes still reach the retained source and appear when it is restored.

A second public UIKit fixture places a source at y=710 and its preview at y=229,
well apart: the source stops painting during preview and returns on dismissal,
while the unrelated comparison bubble stays painted. Its original frame, alpha
and hidden flag remain unchanged; pixels establish the suppression, not those
flags (`/tmp/messages-preview-source/`). Applying that visible behavior to the
custom panel removes the exposed blue duplicate in saved web and iOS clamped
captures, including the duplicate receipt. Geometry/inspection drives cover
restoration, live Delivered-to-Read updates and focused-source isolation; physical
Simulator drives repeat long/double taps, reaction hits, palette dragging,
outside dismissal and keyboard/draft retention. Switching appearance while the
source is suppressed restores its current light/dark colour on dismissal,
verified in saved pixels on both hosts. This still does not reproduce
UIKit's lift/return animation or establish Messages' exact treatment of surrounding
reaction badges, group avatars and sender labels.

Borders now declare solid explicitly. Shared effective widths and `currentColor` preserve the native conversation capture exactly while restoring the browser reaction border; seven native style/colour states and Fieldnotes border controls pass (`/tmp/messages-border-semantics/`).

This is not yet iMessage parity. Remaining work includes resolving back-swiping
over the transcript, matching the remaining Tapback presentation details,
swipe reply motion matching, timestamp settling, scroll anchoring during animated changes, typing-indicator
motion matching, message insertion motion, precise bubble and fractional border geometry, native symbols and glass materials, dark appearance refinement, and direct
visual/gesture comparison with Messages on the target iOS version. Contact actions, group details and
attachment surfaces remain unfinished. Keyboard gesture/animation parity still needs direct comparison with Messages; text injection alone is not that proof.
