//! Contract syntax: the lexer, the AST, and the parser.
//!
//! @ref LLP 1004 D3 (the language basis: Contract v1 Edition 1, scoped to the
//! v1 app's constructs) / LLP 0508 (research)
//!
//! The grammar is indentation-structured. A file is a sequence of `shape` and
//! `component` declarations; a component holds `props`, `state`, `derive`,
//! `resource`, `action`, `task`, and `view` sections; a view is a tree of
//! elements, component uses, and the three region constructs `when`/`else`,
//! `each … in … key=…`, and `match … case some(x) / case none`. Expressions
//! are closed: literals, template strings, names, member access, calls,
//! arithmetic, comparison, boolean logic, the conditional operator, `some`,
//! `none`, and inline `match`.
//!
//! Every node carries a [`Span`]; every rejection is a [`SyntaxError`] with
//! one stable id and a span. Nothing here knows about types or the plan.
